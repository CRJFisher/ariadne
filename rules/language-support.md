# Language Support

- This tool is for parsing many different programming languages.
- We need to support all these languages.
- We need to structure the code so that the processing explicitly handles any language-specific features.
- When writing language-specific code, ideally at the processing function to the LanguageConfiguration object, so that new languages know to account for that feature processing requirement.
