# Coding Standards

## Coding Style

- Prefer a functional style of coding.
- Classes should be for holding immutable data. Functions should be for performing actions.
- _Never_ use stateful classes.

## Naming Rules

- Use pythonic naming conventions- snake_case for all typescript names (variables, functions, files, etc.) other than class names which should be PascalCase.
