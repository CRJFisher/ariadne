# Continue with the next task

- read the task's to-do items and complete them fully, thoroughly, without cutting any corners
- update the task doc as you go including any insights or key decisions
- double check that the files follow the @docs/Architecture.md structure e.g. tests are colocated with the code, not in the /tests folder
- commit changes
- check if any work was skipped during the task implementation. If there were any follow-up tasks, create them as sub-tasks
