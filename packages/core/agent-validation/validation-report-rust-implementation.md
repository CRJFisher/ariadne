## Ariadne Agent Validation Report - Rust Cross-file Implementation

### Summary
- Total nodes validated: 121 functions
- Top-level identification accuracy: **NEEDS INVESTIGATION** - Many nodes marked as top-level are actually called
- Call relationships: 100 total calls detected
- File summary: 19 files analyzed (project_call_graph.ts skipped due to 57KB size)

### Key Findings

#### 1. Top-Level Node Validation Issues

Several functions marked as "top-level" (not called by any other function) are actually called:

- ❌ `apply_max_depth_filter` - Found call at `project_call_graph.ts:1314`
- ❌ `extract_function_metadata` - Found call at `scope_resolution.ts:342`

These false positives indicate the call graph is missing some cross-file calls, likely because:
1. The main `project_call_graph.ts` file (57KB) was skipped due to size limits
2. This file contains many of the calls that would connect these functions

#### 2. Call Detection Statistics

The validation output shows:
- **36.6%** of nodes have outgoing calls (37/101)
- **53.5%** of nodes are called by others (54/101)
- **0%** exported nodes detected (known issue per task-62)
- **100%** of edges have call_type field

#### 3. Cross-file Method Resolution

The test output shows extensive debug logging for cross-file method resolution:
- Rust method tracking is working (e.g., "Tracking implicit parameter for method: constructor")
- Method calls are being processed multiple times (duplicate `get_calls_from_definition` calls)
- This aligns with the failing tests showing duplicate call counts

### Issues Found

1. **Missing Cross-file Calls**: Major file `project_call_graph.ts` excluded from analysis
2. **Duplicate Call Processing**: Functions are being processed multiple times
3. **Export Detection**: Still showing 0% exported nodes
4. **File Size Limitation**: 32KB limit excludes critical files from analysis

### Recommendations

1. **Increase file size limit** or implement file chunking for large files
2. **Fix duplicate call tracking** (task-32, task-33)
3. **Implement proper export detection** (blocked by task-30)
4. **Add deduplication** to prevent processing functions multiple times

### Conclusion

The Rust cross-file method resolution implementation is partially working but has significant issues:
- Cross-file resolution logic is implemented and processing
- Duplicate processing is causing test failures
- Missing analysis of large files creates false top-level nodes

The implementation successfully tracks method calls and resolves cross-file references, but the duplicate processing and missing file analysis significantly impact accuracy.
