# AST-Climber v0.5.8 - Library Renamed ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸš€ Major Change: RefScope is now AST-Climber!

We're excited to announce that RefScope has been renamed to **AST-Climber**. This new name better reflects what our library does - it climbs the Abstract Syntax Tree to analyze your code's structure and relationships.
