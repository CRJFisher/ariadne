Reorganized the project into a monorepo structure with separate packages for core functionality and types.

- Created `@ariadne/core` package containing all implementation code
- Created `@ariadne/types` package with zero-dependency TypeScript types
- Set up npm workspaces for managing the monorepo
- Configured changesets for coordinated versioning and releasing
