# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with monorepos to help version and publish your packages. You can find the full documentation for changesets [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to Use Changesets in Ariadne

### Creating a Changeset

When you make changes to any package, create a changeset to document the change:

```bash
npx changeset
# or
npm run changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of change (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning

When ready to release, run:

```bash
npm run version
```

This will:
- Update package versions based on changesets
- Update package.json files
- Generate/update CHANGELOG files
- Delete consumed changesets

### Publishing

After versioning, publish to npm:

```bash
npm run release
```

## Configuration

Our monorepo is configured with:
- **Linked packages**: `@ariadne/core` and `@ariadne/types` are linked, meaning they'll always be released together with the same version
- **Access**: Public packages on npm
- **Base branch**: `main`

## Workflow

1. Make your changes
2. Run `npx changeset` to create a changeset file
3. Commit the changeset file with your PR
4. When ready to release, run `npm run version` then `npm run release`

## GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Action that:
- Comments on PRs about missing changesets
- Can create release PRs automatically
- Publishes to npm when release PRs are merged
