# Renamed Imports Implementation Summary

## Overview

We successfully implemented support for renamed imports in the TypeScript tree-sitter implementation. This allows the symbol resolver to correctly handle import statements like:

```typescript
import { formatDate as format, parseDate as parse } from './helpers';
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Import Node Structure (graph.ts)

Added optional fields to the Import interface to store the original export name:

```typescript
export interface Import extends BaseNode {
  kind: 'import';
  name: string;          // Local name (as used in this file)
  source_name?: string;  // Original export name (if renamed)
  source_module?: string; // Module path (e.g., './utils')
}
```

### 2. Modified Tree-sitter Query (scopes.scm)

Updated the TypeScript scope query to distinguish renamed imports:

```scheme
(import_statement
  (import_clause
    (named_imports
      [(import_specifier !alias (identifier) @local.import)
       (import_specifier alias: (identifier) @local.import.renamed)])))
```

The `.renamed` suffix on the capture name helps identify when an import has been renamed.

### 3. Enhanced Scope Resolution (scope-resolution.ts)

Added logic to extract the source name from renamed imports:

```typescript
// If this is a renamed import, capture has 'renamed' suffix
if (parts[2] === 'renamed' && node.parent && node.parent.type === 'import_specifier') {
  // Get the source name from the first child of import_specifier
  const import_spec = node.parent;
  if (import_spec.childCount >= 3) {
    source_name = import_spec.child(0)?.text;
  }
}
```

### 4. Updated Symbol Resolution (symbol-resolver.ts)

Modified both `find_definition` and `find_all_references` to use the source_name when available:

```typescript
// Use source_name if available (for renamed imports), otherwise use the import name
const export_name = imp.source_name || imp.name;
```

## Test Results

All tests pass, including the new test case that verifies:
- `import { formatDate as format }` correctly resolves `format` to the `formatDate` export
- Cross-file definition finding works with renamed imports
- References to renamed imports are properly tracked

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Navigation**: Go-to-definition now correctly jumps to the original export, not just the import statement
2. **Proper Reference Tracking**: Find-all-references works correctly across renamed imports
3. **Language-Specific Handling**: The solution uses TypeScript's AST structure without requiring a generic language-agnostic approach
4. **Minimal Changes**: The implementation required only small, targeted changes to existing code

## Technical Approach

We chose to enhance the Import node with metadata (Option 1 from the design document) because:
- It required minimal changes to the existing architecture
- It leverages tree-sitter's AST information directly
- It maintains compatibility with the existing resolution algorithm
- It's efficient and doesn't require additional parsing passes

This implementation successfully addresses the renamed import limitation while maintaining the clean architecture of the original design.
