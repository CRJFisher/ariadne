# Task Summary - Rust Cross-file Implementation

## Completed Work (Done Tasks)

### task-12: Implement Rust cross-file method resolution âœ…
- Successfully implemented Type::method() pattern recognition
- Added instance method resolution through variable type tracking
- Implemented private method filtering
- All Rust cross-file tests now pass

## Outstanding Work (To Do Tasks)

### High Priority - Test Failures
1. **task-1**: Fix duplicate call tracking causing test failures
2. **task-2**: Fix failing call_graph.test.ts tests with incorrect call counts
3. **task-3**: Fix methods incorrectly appearing in top-level nodes
4. **task-4**: Investigate and fix remaining test suite failures

### High Priority - Functionality
5. **task-5**: Fix get_all_functions to properly handle methods vs functions
6. **task-6**: Add support for Rust crate:: module paths
7. **task-7**: Add comprehensive import/export tests for all languages
11. **task-11**: Create generic validation script for external repositories
13. **task-13**: Fix file size limit preventing analysis of large files

### Medium Priority
8. **task-8**: Handle variable reassignments in type registry
9. **task-9**: Add edge case tests for cross-file resolution

### Low Priority
10. **task-10**: Document supported import/export patterns

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Processing**: Methods are being processed multiple times causing doubled call counts
2. **File Size Limits**: Large files (>32KB) are skipped in validation, missing critical connections
3. **Export Detection**: Still showing 0% exported nodes (blocked by task-30)
4. **Top-level Accuracy**: False positives due to missing file analysis

## Next Steps

1. Fix duplicate call tracking (tasks 1-4) - This is blocking all other work
2. Increase file size limits (task 13) - Critical for accurate validation
3. Complete remaining language support (task 6) - Rust crate:: paths
4. Add comprehensive tests (tasks 7, 9) - Ensure robustness

## Notes

- The Rust cross-file implementation is fundamentally working
- Main issues are with duplicate processing and test infrastructure
- All cross-file tests pass when run individually
- Validation shows the implementation correctly tracks and resolves method calls
