# Task Reorganization Summary

## Completed Actions âœ…

### 1. Updated Folder Structure
- Created `backlog/tasks/operations/` for recurring processes
- Created `backlog/tasks/epics/` for major feature collections
- Moved operations files to new location
- Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive documentation

### 2. Created 9 Epics

1. **Type System & Inference** (HIGH priority)
2. **Import/Export Resolution** (MEDIUM priority)
3. **Language Support & Edge Cases** (LOW priority)
4. **Performance & Scalability** (HIGH priority)
5. **MCP Server Features** (MEDIUM priority)
6. **Call Graph Enhancement** (MEDIUM priority)
7. **Documentation & Testing** (MEDIUM priority)
8. **Bug Fixes & Regressions** (COMPLETED - to archive)
9. **Test Suite Maintenance** (HIGH priority - NEW)

### 3. Added Initial Audit Tasks
Each epic now includes an initial audit task to:
- Review module/folder structure
- Check naming clarity
- Identify oversized files
- Generate refactoring sub-tasks

### 4. Established Refactoring Process
Each refactoring sub-epic must:
1. Execute specific refactoring tasks from audit
2. Apply `testing-standards.md`
3. Apply `coding-standards.md`

### 5. Created Test Maintenance Tasks
Identified and created tasks for:
- `call_graph.test.ts` (51KB) - task-epic-9-test-maintenance.1
- `javascript.test.ts` (41KB) - task-epic-9-test-maintenance.2

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate
1. Archive completed task-100 sub-tasks to epic-8-completed
2. Move active tasks to appropriate epics
3. Delete duplicate tasks (100.35, 100.36)

### This Week
1. Begin initial audits for each epic
2. Start splitting oversized test files
3. Create epic README files for remaining epics

### Ongoing
1. Run agent-validation-process weekly
2. Monitor test file sizes
3. Apply standards to all new code
