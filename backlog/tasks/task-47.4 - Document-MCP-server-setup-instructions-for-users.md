## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for setting up the Ariadne MCP server with various hosts. Research and provide setup instructions for Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools. Include generic setup patterns where possible to avoid duplicating host-specific details.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Setup instructions documented for major MCP hosts
- [x] Generic setup pattern identified and documented
- [x] Host-specific configuration examples provided
- [x] Troubleshooting section added
- [x] Documentation integrated into main README or separate SETUP.md

## Implementation Plan

1. Research MCP setup documentation for Claude Desktop
2. Research MCP setup documentation for VS Code  
3. Research MCP setup documentation for Cursor
4. Identify common configuration patterns across all hosts
5. Create comprehensive SETUP.md with generic and host-specific instructions
6. Add troubleshooting section for common issues
7. Update main README to reference setup guide

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive setup documentation in SETUP.md covering Claude Desktop, VS Code, and Cursor. Identified generic configuration pattern using JSON with command/args/env structure. Documented host-specific paths and setup procedures, advanced configurations, troubleshooting steps, and security considerations. Updated main README to reference the setup guide.
