## Description

The CallAnalysisConfig currently only has access to the cache for the current file being analyzed. For proper cross-file method resolution, it needs access to caches from other files to compute enclosing_range for imported classes. This limitation forces fallback to using just the class definition range.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CallAnalysisConfig includes a method to access file caches from other files
- [x] Cross-file method resolution can properly compute class enclosing ranges
- [x] The solution maintains immutability principles

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current CallAnalysisConfig interface
2. Add get_file_cache method to the interface
3. Update places where CallAnalysisConfig is created to provide file cache access
4. Update cross-file method resolution to use the file cache
5. Test the implementation

## Implementation Notes

Successfully added cross-file cache access to CallAnalysisConfig:

1. **Interface Update**: Added `get_file_cache?: (file_path: string) => FileCache | undefined` to the CallAnalysisConfig interface
2. **Implementation**: Updated both CallAnalysisConfig creation sites in index.ts to provide the get_file_cache method
3. **Cross-file Resolution**: Enhanced resolve_method_call_pure to compute enclosing_range using the file cache when not already available
4. **Enclosing Range Computation**: Improved compute_class_enclosing_range to properly traverse the AST and find the full class/struct/interface node

The solution maintains immutability by using readonly properties and pure functions throughout.
