## Description

The CallAnalysisConfig currently only has access to the cache for the current file being analyzed. For proper cross-file method resolution, it needs access to caches from other files to compute enclosing_range for imported classes. This limitation forces fallback to using just the class definition range.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CallAnalysisConfig includes a method to access file caches from other files
- [ ] Cross-file method resolution can properly compute class enclosing ranges
- [ ] The solution maintains immutability principles
