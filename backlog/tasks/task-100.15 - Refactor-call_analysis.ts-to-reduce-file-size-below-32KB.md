## Description

The call_analysis.ts file has reached the 32KB limit, preventing commits with file size checks enabled. This file needs to be refactored to split functionality into smaller, more focused modules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File size is below 28KB warning threshold
- [ ] Core functionality is preserved
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code is properly organized into logical modules
