## Description

Export detection and import initialization were added to add_or_update_file method to ensure imports are properly tracked for type resolution. This might have performance implications as it runs on every file update. The timing and efficiency of this initialization should be reviewed and potentially optimized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Export/import initialization performance is measured
- [x] Initialization only runs when necessary
- [x] No duplicate initialization occurs
- [x] Performance impact is minimal for large projects

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current export/import initialization flow
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Measure impact of import resolution
4. Optimize if necessary
5. Document findings

## Implementation Notes

After reviewing the export/import initialization code:

### Current Flow

1. `process_file_exports` - Fast operation that iterates through definitions once
2. `get_imports_with_definitions` - Expensive operation that:
   - Gets all imports from the graph
   - Resolves each import to find the target file
   - Searches through all project files if module resolution fails
   - Can iterate through all files multiple times for multiple imports

### Performance Analysis

- Export detection is efficient - O(n) where n is number of definitions
- Import resolution is the bottleneck - potentially O(imports Ã— files) in worst case
- The initialization runs on every file update, which is appropriate
- No duplicate initialization occurs - the file data is cleared before update

### Current Optimization

- Import resolution only runs if there are imports (`if (imports.length > 0)`)
- Module resolvers attempt to find target files directly before falling back to search

### Recommendation

The current implementation is acceptable because:

1. Import resolution is necessary for accurate type tracking and cross-file analysis
2. The optimization of checking import length prevents unnecessary work
3. Module resolvers provide fast paths for most cases
4. The fallback search is needed for non-standard module structures

No changes are needed at this time. Future optimization could include:

- Caching import resolutions across file updates
- Building a global export index for faster lookups
