## Description

JavaScript parsing tests show that variable hoisting is not working correctly. Variables declared with 'var' are not being placed in the correct scope, and the hoisting behavior is inconsistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JavaScript variable hoisting works correctly
- [ ] Var declarations are hoisted to function scope
- [ ] All JavaScript parsing tests pass
