## Description

Currently, the entire file is re-parsed when content changes. Implement incremental parsing using tree-sitter's edit capabilities to improve performance for large files and real-time editing scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement incremental parsing in Project.add_or_update_file
- [ ] Track file edits and apply them to existing trees
- [ ] Update scope graph incrementally when possible
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing full vs incremental parsing
- [ ] Ensure accuracy is maintained with incremental updates

## Implementation Notes

This is crucial for editor integration where files are constantly being edited. Consider caching parsed trees and only updating affected portions of the scope graph.\n\nTechnical Details:\nTree-sitter supports incremental parsing through:\n
