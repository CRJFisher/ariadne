## Description

The MCP server documentation currently lacks clarity about its purpose and value proposition. Users struggle to understand what the tool does and why they would use it. The documentation needs to be restructured to clearly communicate the server's functionality, use cases, and benefits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clear value proposition stated in the first paragraph of the docs
- [ ] Use cases and examples prominently featured
- [ ] Step-by-step getting started guide simplified
- [ ] Technical jargon reduced or explained
- [ ] Benefits of using the MCP server clearly articulated
