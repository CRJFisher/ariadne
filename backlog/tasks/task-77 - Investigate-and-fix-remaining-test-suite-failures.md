## Description

After implementing Rust cross-file method resolution, multiple test files are failing including incremental.test.ts, index.test.ts, inheritance.test.ts, and language-specific tests. Need to identify root causes and fix all failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All test suites pass
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Cross-file resolution works without breaking other features
