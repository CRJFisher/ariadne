## Description

Implement MCP tools and resources that expose Ariadne's code structure in a hierarchical tree format, enabling AI agents to visualize and navigate codebases during architecture analysis phases.
Cursor produces very nice code flow diagrams, rendered in mermaid.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP tool for visualizing code tree structure
- [ ] Support for filtering by file types and patterns
- [ ] Token-efficient tree representation for AI consumption
- [ ] Resource endpoints for browsing code hierarchy
- [ ] Tests for tree visualization tools
- [ ] Documentation with usage examples
