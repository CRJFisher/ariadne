## Description

Before implementing comprehensive import resolution, research and document the import/module systems for all languages supported by AST-Climber. This ensures we don't miss any language-specific requirements when building the import resolution system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document import patterns for TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] Document import patterns for Python
- [ ] Document import patterns for Rust
- [ ] Research any other languages AST-Climber supports
- [ ] Identify common patterns across languages
- [ ] Identify unique requirements per language
- [ ] Create a reference document for import patterns
- [ ] Update task 28 if new requirements are found
