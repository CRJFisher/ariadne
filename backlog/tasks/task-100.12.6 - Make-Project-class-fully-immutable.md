## Description

Convert the Project class to be fully immutable, where all operations return new Project instances instead of mutating state. This is the final step after extracting concerns and implementing storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project class has no mutable properties
- [x] All methods return new Project instances
- [x] State updates go through storage interface
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained with deprecation warnings
- [x] Performance is acceptable

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current Project class implementation
2. Identify all mutable state and methods
3. Create immutable Project class using storage
4. Update all mutating methods to return new instances
5. Add backward compatibility layer with deprecation warnings
6. Update tests to verify immutability
7. Performance testing and optimization

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented fully immutable Project class:

1. **ImmutableProject** (`project/immutable_project.ts`):
   - Uses storage interface for all state management
   - All operations use transactions for atomic updates
   - Delegates to extracted services (FileManager, NavigationService, etc.)
   - Maintains immutable state through storage layer
   - Provides withState method for advanced state updates

2. **Backward compatibility wrapper** (`project.ts`):
   - Maintains mutable API for existing code
   - Shows deprecation warnings in development
   - Internally uses ImmutableProject
   - All tests pass with warnings

3. **Key features**:
   - No mutable properties in ImmutableProject
   - State updates go through storage interface
   - Performance maintained through efficient storage
   - Complete API compatibility
   - Fixed import issues between modules
   - Added Edit interface conversion for tree-sitter compatibility

4. **Tests** (`tests/immutable_project.test.ts`):
   - Created comprehensive test suite for ImmutableProject
   - All 9 tests passing
   - Verifies immutability and functionality
   - Tests navigation, references, multi-language support
   - Tests incremental updates and state management

5. **Files created/modified**:
   - Created `src/project/immutable_project.ts` - Main immutable implementation
   - Created `src/project.ts` - Backward compatibility wrapper
   - Updated `src/index.ts` - Export new classes and interfaces
   - Created `src/project/index.ts` - Project module exports
   - Fixed `src/project/file_manager.ts` - Import corrections
   - Created `tests/immutable_project.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests
