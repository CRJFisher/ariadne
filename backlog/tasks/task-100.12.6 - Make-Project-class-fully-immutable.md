## Description

Convert the Project class to be fully immutable, where all operations return new Project instances instead of mutating state. This is the final step after extracting concerns and implementing storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project class has no mutable properties
- [ ] All methods return new Project instances
- [ ] State updates go through storage interface
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with deprecation warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
