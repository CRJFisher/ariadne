## Description

Implement MCP tools that allow AI agents to preview the impact of refactoring operations (rename, extract, move) before applying them. This enables planning phase analysis of code changes with diff generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP tool for previewing symbol rename across files
- [ ] MCP tool for previewing function/method extraction
- [ ] MCP tool for previewing module moves
- [ ] Unified diff generation for proposed changes
- [ ] Risk assessment for refactoring operations
- [ ] Tests for diff preview functionality
- [ ] Documentation with refactoring examples
