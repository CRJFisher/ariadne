## Description

Implement the logic to build a complete call graph by analyzing all functions and their call references across the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Algorithm correctly identifies all function calls
- [ ] Self/this method calls are properly detected
- [ ] Call graph handles recursive calls
- [ ] Call graph handles indirect calls via variables
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large codebases
