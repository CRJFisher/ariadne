## Description

When imports reference non-existent files or exports, the system should handle it gracefully and continue analyzing what it can. Currently it may fail or produce incorrect results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Missing file imports don't crash analysis
- [ ] Non-existent exports are handled gracefully
- [ ] Valid code is still analyzed correctly
- [ ] Error recovery allows partial analysis
