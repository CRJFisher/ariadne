## Description

Add ariadne-mcp as an MCP server to Claude Code and validate its outputs through typical code exploration workflows. This provides real-world validation by having Claude Code use Ariadne's analysis in actual grep/find workflows, ensuring the tool provides accurate and useful information for AI-assisted development.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ariadne-MCP successfully added as MCP server to Claude Code
- [ ] Claude Code can query Ariadne for function definitions and call graphs
- [ ] Ariadne's outputs match manual grep/find results for the same queries
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for interactive use
- [ ] Documentation created for setting up and using Ariadne-MCP with Claude Code

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up ariadne-mcp as an MCP server in Claude Code configuration
2. Create test scenarios for typical code exploration workflows:
   - Finding function definitions
   - Tracing call paths
   - Understanding code dependencies
   - Locating implementations of interfaces/classes
3. For each scenario, compare Ariadne results with manual grep/find commands
4. Document any discrepancies or missing information
5. Measure performance for interactive use
6. Create setup documentation for other users
7. Provide feedback on improvements needed for AI workflow integration
