# Epic 3: Language Support & Edge Cases 🌐

**Priority: LOW** - Nice to have

## Goal
Expand language support and handle language-specific edge cases to ensure robust parsing and analysis across all supported languages.

## Tasks

### In Progress
- [ ] task-100.43: Fix JavaScript scope hoisting issues
- [ ] task-100.44: Fix TypeScript TSX reference tracking
- [ ] task-100.33: Fix edge-case handling in cross-file resolution

### To Do
- [ ] task-12: Add R language support
- [ ] task-13: Add COBOL language support

## Refactoring Process
When adding new languages or fixing edge cases:
1. Follow language configuration patterns
2. Apply `@rules/refactoring.md` for all changes
3. Follow `@rules/testing.md` for test coverage
4. Follow `@rules/coding.md` for code style

## Success Criteria
- Each language properly configured
- Edge cases documented and tested
- Language-specific features properly handled
- Test coverage for each language >80%
