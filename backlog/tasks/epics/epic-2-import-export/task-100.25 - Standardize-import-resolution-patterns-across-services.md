## Description

Ensure consistent use of import resolution service across the codebase after creating the dedicated ImportResolver. Currently different services handle imports differently, leading to inconsistent behavior and duplicate logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All import resolution goes through the centralized ImportResolver service
- [ ] NavigationService and QueryService use consistent patterns for import handling
- [ ] No duplicate import resolution logic across different services
- [ ] Clear documentation of which service owns what import-related functionality
- [ ] Consistent error handling and return types across all import resolution usage
- [ ] Migration guide for any breaking changes to import resolution APIs
