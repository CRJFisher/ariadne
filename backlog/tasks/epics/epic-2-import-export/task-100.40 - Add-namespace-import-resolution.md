## Description

The pattern 'import * as namespace from ./module' followed by namespace.function() calls is not fully resolved. The namespace access pattern needs special handling to resolve nested property access.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Namespace imports are properly resolved
- [ ] namespace.method() calls are tracked
- [ ] Nested namespace access works
- [ ] Re-exported namespaces are handled
