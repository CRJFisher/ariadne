## Description

Complex method chains like api.request().get().withAuth().send() are not fully resolved. Only the first level of calls is tracked. Need to track return types from methods to enable multi-level method resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Method chaining is fully resolved
- [ ] Return types are tracked for chained calls
- [ ] Multi-level method calls work across files
- [ ] Fluent API patterns are supported
