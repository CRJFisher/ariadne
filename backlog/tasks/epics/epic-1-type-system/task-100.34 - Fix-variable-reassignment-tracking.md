## Description

Variable reassignment is not being tracked correctly. Multiple reassignments in sequence and reassignments in different scopes are both returning incorrect call counts, suggesting the type tracking system is not handling variable reassignments properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multiple reassignments in sequence are tracked correctly
- [ ] Reassignments in different scopes are handled properly
- [ ] Variable type changes are tracked through reassignments

## Implementation Notes

Note: This task has been superseded by task-100.42 which has more detailed requirements and acceptance criteria. Consider archiving this task.
