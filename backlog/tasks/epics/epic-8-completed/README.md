- [x] task-100.20: Create dedicated ImportResolver service
- [x] task-100.20.1: Eliminate redundant NavigationService
- [x] task-100.27: Fix class inheritance analysis regression
- [x] task-100.28: Fix get_source_code regression
- [x] task-100.29: Fix incremental parsing
- [x] task-100.30: Fix cross-file call tracking for all languages
- [x] task-100.32: Fix method call detection on built-in types
- [x] task-100.37: Fix Rust cross-file method resolution
- [x] task-100.38: Add recursive/self-referential call tracking
- [x] task-100.9: Add CommonJS and ES6 export support
- [x] task-100.41: Add graceful error handling for missing imports
- [x] task-100.42: Fix variable reassignment type tracking
- [x] task-100.31: Fix large file handling

## Lessons Learned
- NavigationService was redundant with ImportResolver
- Cross-file tracking needed language-specific handling
- Type tracking required proper reassignment support
- Import resolution needed graceful error handling

## Refactoring Applied
All fixes followed:
- `@rules/refactoring.md` for code changes
- `@rules/testing.md` for test coverage
- `@rules/coding.md` for code style

## Success Achieved
- Cross-file call tracking working for all languages
- Import resolution robust with error handling
- Type system properly tracks reassignments
- All critical regressions fixed
