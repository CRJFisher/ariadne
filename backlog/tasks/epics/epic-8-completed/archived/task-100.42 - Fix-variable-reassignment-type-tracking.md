## Description

Variable reassignment is not being tracked correctly. When a variable is reassigned to a different type/value, method calls should resolve to the new type's methods, not the original. This affects type inference accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Variable reassignments update type tracking
- [ ] Method calls resolve to current type after reassignment
- [ ] Multiple reassignments in sequence work correctly
- [ ] Reassignments in different scopes handled properly
