## Description

Class inheritance analysis is completely broken. All inheritance tests are failing with null results. The get_class_relationships, find_subclasses, find_implementations, and other inheritance methods are returning null or empty arrays instead of proper results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All inheritance tests pass
- [ ] get_class_relationships returns proper ClassRelationship objects
- [ ] find_subclasses finds all subclasses
- [ ] find_implementations finds all implementations
