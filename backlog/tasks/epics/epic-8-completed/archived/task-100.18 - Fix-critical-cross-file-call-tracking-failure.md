## Description

Cross-file function calls are completely broken in Ariadne. Import resolution works but resolved functions are not being added to the call graph. This is why validation shows only 32% of nodes with calls instead of the 85% target.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cross-file function calls are tracked correctly
- [ ] Validation shows 85%+ nodes with calls
- [ ] Test case with imported function calls passes
- [ ] Call graph includes edges between files

## Implementation Plan

1. Add debug logging to resolve_reference() to trace import resolution
2. Check if follow_import() is returning the resolved function correctly
3. Verify the resolved function has correct symbol_kind ('function' not 'import')
4. Fix the logic that's preventing imported functions from being added to calls
5. Create regression test for cross-file calls
6. Re-run validation to confirm 85%+ thresholds achieved

## Implementation Notes

## Critical Discovery

Cross-file function calls are completely broken. This is NOT a validation script issue but a fundamental bug in Ariadne's call analysis.

## Root Cause
The cross-file call tracking was completely broken because the getImportInfo() method in ScopeGraph was not implemented - it was just returning an empty array. This meant that when resolve_reference() tried to follow imports, it couldn't find any imports to match against.

## Solution Implemented
1. Made follow_import() more lenient - it now tries name-only matching if exact position matching fails
2. Added fallback logic to treat unresolved imports as callable if they're being called
3. Fixed Project class to use QueryService.getImportsWithDefinitions() instead of NavigationService.getImportsWithDefinitions()
   - NavigationService was calling the unimplemented graph.getImportInfo()
   - QueryService has the proper implementation with module resolution logic

## Files Modified
- packages/core/src/call_graph/call_analysis/reference_resolution.ts: Made import matching more lenient
- packages/core/src/call_graph/call_analysis/core.ts: Added fallback for unresolved imports being called
- packages/core/src/project/project.ts: Fixed to use QueryService instead of NavigationService for imports
- packages/core/tests/regression/cross_file_calls.test.ts: Added comprehensive test suite

## Test Results
All 3 cross-file call tests are now passing, confirming that:
- Basic cross-file calls are tracked
- Default exports are handled correctly
- Renamed imports work properly
## Evidence

Test case proving the bug:

```javascript
// lib.ts
export function libraryFunction() {}

// main.ts
import { libraryFunction } from "./lib";
function mainFunction() {
  libraryFunction(); // ❌ NOT tracked
  console.log("hi"); // ✅ Tracked
}
```

Result: Only console.log is tracked, cross-file call missing.

## What IS Working

1. Import detection: get_imports_with_definitions() correctly finds imports
2. Import resolution: go_to_definition() returns import with symbol_kind: 'import'
3. Import following: follow_import() correctly resolves to actual function
4. Reference detection: libraryFunction reference IS detected at correct position
5. Call detection: is_reference_called() correctly identifies it as a call
6. Intra-file calls: Functions calling others in SAME file work perfectly
7. Built-in calls: console.log, Array methods tracked (after our fixes)

## What is BROKEN

1. Cross-file calls: ANY call to an imported function is not tracked
2. Only 197 total calls found (all intra-file) vs thousands expected
3. 32% nodes with calls (should be 85%+)
4. 36% nodes called by others (should be 85%+)

## Debug Findings

In analyze_calls_from_definition (core.ts line 124-145):

- References ARE found (libraryFunction at row 4, col 2)
- resolve_reference() is called
- But resolved.resolved is somehow not being set correctly for imports

The chain should be:

1. go_to_definition returns import definition
2. follow_import resolves to actual function
3. Return resolved function
4. Add to calls list

Something breaks between steps 2-3.

## Key Code Locations

- packages/core/src/call_graph/call_analysis/core.ts:124-145 (main loop)
- packages/core/src/call_graph/call_analysis/reference_resolution.ts:59-97 (resolve_reference)
- packages/core/src/call_graph/call_analysis/reference_resolution.ts:248-265 (follow_import)

## Test Files Created

- /Users/chuck/workspace/ariadne/verify-cross-file.js (proves bug)
- /Users/chuck/workspace/ariadne/test-call-analysis-manually.js (shows only 1 call)
- /Users/chuck/workspace/ariadne/check-imports.js (shows imports work)
- /Users/chuck/workspace/ariadne/debug-references.js (shows refs detected)

## Impact

This bug makes Ariadne fundamentally broken for any real codebase analysis as it can only see calls within single files, missing all cross-module dependencies.
