## Description

Implement tree-sitter parsing to identify and analyze key branching control flow structures including conditionals, loops, and their scopes. This capability will enable detection of conditional code branching patterns and support the generation of code flow visualizations and flow charts. The parsed control flow data will serve as a foundation for modeling code execution paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tree-sitter parser identifies all conditional statements (if/else/switch)
- [ ] Tree-sitter parser identifies all loop structures (for/while/do-while)
- [ ] Scope boundaries are correctly detected for each control flow structure
- [ ] Nested control flow structures are properly handled
- [ ] Parser outputs structured data suitable for flow chart generation
- [ ] Integration with existing language processing system
- [ ] Support for multiple programming languages via tree-sitter grammars
