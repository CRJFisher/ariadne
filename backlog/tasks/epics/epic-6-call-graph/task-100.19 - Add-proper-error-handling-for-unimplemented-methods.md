## Description

Replace silent failures (returning empty arrays/null) with explicit 'not implemented' errors to make debugging easier. Currently many methods return empty results as placeholders which makes it difficult to distinguish between genuinely empty results and unimplemented functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All TODO/unimplemented methods throw NotImplementedError with descriptive messages
- [ ] No methods return empty results as placeholders for unimplemented functionality
- [ ] Error messages include helpful context about what functionality is missing
- [ ] Clear distinction between empty results and unimplemented features
