## Description

Fix semantic_index.javascript.test.ts:

1. Update fixture paths to tests/fixtures/javascript/
2. Remove tests for unsupported JavaScript features
3. Ensure all tests verify current SemanticIndex structure
4. Achieve 100% pass rate (currently 4/16 failing)

No metadata file exists for JavaScript.
