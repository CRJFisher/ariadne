## Description

Verify comprehensive coverage of Rust features we DO need:
- Struct definitions and impl blocks
- Enums and variants
- Traits and trait implementations
- Associated functions vs methods (self parameter)
- Function calls and method calls
- Use statements (imports)
- Module declarations

Add missing tests if needed.
