## Description

Migrate JavaScript scope patterns to src/scope_queries/

## Research Phase

**NOTE**: First read `CODEBASE_HIERARCHY_ANALYSIS.md` sections:
- `## Current Codebase Structure (As Implemented)` - understand current locations
- `### Proposed Structure` - understand target architecture

### Current Location

- [ ] Find where javascript.scm currently lives
- [ ] Document current implementation
- [ ] Identify dependencies

### Test Location

- [ ] Find all tests related to javascript.scm
- [ ] Document test coverage
- [ ] Identify missing test cases

## Planning Phase

### Architecture Verification

- [ ] Verify against docs/Architecture.md patterns
- [ ] Ensure functional paradigm (no classes)
- [ ] Plan implementation approach

## Implementation Phase

### Code Migration

- [ ] Create/move to src/scope_queries/javascript.scm
- [ ] Update implementation as needed
- [ ] Update all imports

### Test Migration

- [ ] Move/create tests as needed
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Add missing test coverage

## Verification Phase

### Quality Checks

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Follows rules/coding.md standards
- [ ] Files under 32KB limit
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass

## Notes

Research findings will be documented here during execution.
