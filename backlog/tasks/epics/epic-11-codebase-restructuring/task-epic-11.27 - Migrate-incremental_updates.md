## Description

Migrate the `incremental_updates` feature to `src/project/incremental_updates/` following Architecture.md patterns.

## Research Phase

**NOTE**: First read `CODEBASE_HIERARCHY_ANALYSIS.md` sections:
- `## Current Codebase Structure (As Implemented)` - understand current locations
- `### Proposed Structure` - understand target architecture

### Current Location

- [ ] Find where incremental_updates currently lives
- [ ] Document all language-specific implementations
- [ ] Identify common logic vs language-specific logic

### Test Location

- [ ] Find all tests related to incremental_updates
- [ ] Document test coverage for each language
- [ ] Identify missing test cases

## Planning Phase

### Folder Structure

- [ ] Determine if sub-folders needed for complex logic
- [ ] Plan file organization per Architecture.md patterns
- [ ] List all files to create

### Architecture Verification

- [ ] Verify against docs/Architecture.md folder patterns
- [ ] Ensure functional paradigm (no classes)
- [ ] Plan dispatcher/marshaler pattern

## Implementation Phase

### Code Migration

- [ ] Create folder structure at src/project/incremental_updates/
- [ ] Move/create common incremental_updates.ts
- [ ] Move/create language-specific files
- [ ] Create index.ts dispatcher
- [ ] Update all imports

### Test Migration

- [ ] Move/create incremental_updates.test.ts
- [ ] Move/create language-specific test files
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Add test contract if needed

## Verification Phase

### Quality Checks

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Follows rules/coding.md standards
- [ ] Files under 32KB limit
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass

## Notes

Research findings will be documented here during execution.
