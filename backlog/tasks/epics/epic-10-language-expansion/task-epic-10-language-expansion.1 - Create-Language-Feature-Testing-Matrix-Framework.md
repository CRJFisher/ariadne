## Description

Design and implement a systematic framework for adding new language support with consistent feature coverage and testing. This matrix approach will ensure all languages support the same core features with comprehensive test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Language configuration architecture designed
- [ ] Feature capability matrix defined (Language × Feature × Test)
- [ ] Language addition template created
- [ ] Testing requirements documented per feature
- [ ] Existing languages analyzed for patterns
- [ ] Automated compliance validator created
- [ ] Document the new folder structure in a new @rules/folder-structure.md file
- [ ] Document the new testing framework in a new @rules/testing.md file

## Implementation Notes

### Folder Structure

Most features will be supported by every language and so these follow the structure:

- /src/[feature]/[sub-feature]
  - .../[sub-sub-feature].ts
  - .../[sub-sub-feature].test.ts
    - _important_ - this test file defines all the main _cases_ we should cover for this feature, exported as an interface that the language-specific test files will implement
  - .../[sub-sub-feature].python.test.ts
  - .../[sub-sub-feature].javascript.test.ts
  - ...

This will allow us to run a script to generate the language-specific test files from the main test file and then quickly measure the test coverage for each feature and language.

For highly language-specific features, we will have a folder structure like this:

- /src/[feature]/[sub-feature]/[language]
  - .../[sub-sub-feature].ts
  - .../[sub-sub-feature].test.ts
  - ...

So when adding support for a new feature, it's important to consider if it's common to all languages or if it's language-specific.

> N.B. - the above should be inlcuded in the output documentation, rules etc
