# Epic 10: Language Expansion Framework 🗣️

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Strategic expansion capability

## Goal
Create a systematic framework for adding new language support with consistent feature coverage and testing across all languages. Transform language addition from ad-hoc implementation to a structured, matrix-driven process.

## Initial Refactoring Task (CRITICAL - Do First!)
- [ ] **NEW**: Create Language-Feature-Testing Matrix Framework
  - Design language configuration architecture
  - Create feature capability matrix (3D tensor: Language × Feature × Test Coverage)
  - Standardize language addition process
  - Create language template with all required components
  - Establish testing requirements per feature per language
  - Output: Language addition framework and templates

## Language-Feature-Testing Matrix

### Core Features to Support per Language
Each language implementation must support these features with corresponding tests:

| Feature | Description | Test Requirements |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Parsing** | Basic AST parsing | Parse sample files, handle syntax errors |
| **Definitions** | Function/class/method definitions | Extract all definition types |
| **References** | Variable/function references | Track all reference types |
| **Imports** | Module/package imports | Resolve import paths |
| **Exports** | Public API surface | Identify exported symbols |
| **Calls** | Function/method calls | Track call relationships |
| **Inheritance** | Class/interface inheritance | Resolve parent classes |
| **Type Info** | Type annotations/signatures | Extract type information |
| **Scope** | Scope resolution | Handle nested scopes |
| **Comments** | Doc comments/annotations | Extract documentation |

### Testing Matrix Requirements
For each language × feature combination:
1. **Unit tests**: Feature works in isolation
2. **Integration tests**: Feature works with other features
3. **Cross-file tests**: Feature works across multiple files
4. **Edge case tests**: Handle unusual but valid syntax
5. **Performance tests**: Handle large files efficiently

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Framework Creation
- [ ] **NEW**: Design and implement Language-Feature-Testing Matrix
- [ ] **NEW**: Create language addition template and checklist
- [ ] **NEW**: Refactor existing languages to use new framework
- [ ] **NEW**: Create automated language compliance validator

### Phase 2: Language Implementation
- [ ] task-5: Add Go language support
- [ ] task-6: Add C language support  
- [ ] task-7: Add C++ language support
- [ ] task-8: Add Java language support
- [ ] task-9: Add C# language support
- [ ] task-10: Add Ruby language support
- [ ] task-11: Add PHP language support

### Already in Other Epics
- [x] task-12: Add R language support (Epic 3)
- [x] task-13: Add COBOL language support (Epic 3)

## Language Addition Process (After Framework)

1. **Configuration Phase**
   - Create language config in `src/languages/`
   - Define tree-sitter grammar integration
   - Set up language-specific patterns

2. **Feature Implementation Phase**
   - Implement each matrix feature
   - Follow feature templates
   - Use existing patterns from other languages

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Create test suite following matrix requirements
   - Ensure all feature × test combinations covered
   - Add language-specific edge cases

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Run language compliance validator
   - Check feature coverage percentage
   - Verify cross-language consistency

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document language-specific quirks
   - Add examples for each feature
   - Update supported languages list

## Refactoring Process
When adding the matrix framework:
1. Analyze current language implementations for patterns
2. Extract common functionality into shared utilities
3. Apply `@rules/refactoring.md` for all changes
4. Follow `@rules/testing.md` for test coverage
5. Follow `@rules/coding.md` for code style

## Success Criteria
- Language-Feature-Testing matrix fully defined
- All existing languages refactored to use framework
- New language addition time < 2 days
- 100% feature coverage for core languages
- Automated validation for language compliance
- Each language has >80% test coverage

## Benefits of Matrix Approach

1. **Consistency**: All languages support same features
2. **Quality**: Systematic testing ensures reliability
3. **Speed**: Templates accelerate development
4. **Maintenance**: Changes propagate systematically
5. **Documentation**: Matrix serves as living documentation

## Notes

- R and COBOL remain in Epic 3 as they're edge cases
- This epic focuses on mainstream languages with the framework
- The matrix framework is the critical first step
- Each language should reuse patterns from the framework
