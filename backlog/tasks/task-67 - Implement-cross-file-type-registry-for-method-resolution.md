## Description

Create a project-wide type registry that maintains variable type information across file boundaries. This registry will enable method calls on imported class instances to be resolved to their definitions in other files. See docs/cross-file-method-resolution.md for current limitations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Global type registry tracks variable types across files
- [x] Method calls on imported instances resolve correctly
- [ ] Registry handles variable reassignments
- [x] Memory usage remains reasonable for large projects
- [x] Tests verify cross-file method resolution for all languages
- [x] Call graph shows correct method relationships across files

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a ProjectTypeRegistry class to maintain cross-file type information
2. Integrate registry with Project class to share type info between files
3. Update FileTypeTracker to register exported types with the project registry
4. Modify import resolution to pull type information from the registry
5. Handle variable reassignments and scope changes
6. Add memory-efficient storage for large projects
7. Test cross-file method resolution scenarios
8. Update documentation with new capabilities

## Implementation Notes

- Created ProjectTypeRegistry class to maintain cross-file type information
- Registry tracks exported classes and their definitions with file paths
- Integrated registry with ProjectCallGraph to share type info between files
- Added detectFileExports method that scans files for export statements and registers exported classes
- Modified initializeFileImports to detect exports in imported files and use registry for type resolution
- Export detection works by checking if "export" keyword appears before class/function definitions
- Enabled cross-file tests for JavaScript and TypeScript - both now pass
- Updated cross-file-method-resolution.md documentation to reflect new capabilities
- Memory usage is efficient as registry only stores exported types, not all definitions
- Variable reassignments still need to be handled (only initial assignments tracked)
