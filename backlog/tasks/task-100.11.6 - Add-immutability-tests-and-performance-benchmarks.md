## Description

Create comprehensive tests that verify immutability of all data structures and functions. Add performance benchmarks to ensure the immutable approach doesn't significantly impact performance compared to the mutable version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tests verify all functions return new instances
- [ ] Tests check deep immutability of structures
- [ ] Performance benchmarks compare with original
- [ ] Memory usage is measured and acceptable
- [ ] No performance regressions
