## Description

Extract reference resolution functions (resolve_reference, resolve_call_return_type) into reference_resolution.ts. These functions handle the core logic of resolving references to their definitions and determining return types.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create reference_resolution.ts with extracted functions
- [ ] Maintain pure functional approach
- [ ] Update imports in call_analysis.ts
- [ ] All reference resolution tests pass
