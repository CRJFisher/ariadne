## Description

Research and document how MCP enables AI agents to use tools, focusing on architecture/planning phase capabilities like code tree visualization and refactoring diff previews. Document findings to guide the implementation of @ariadnejs/mcp.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] MCP tool exposure mechanisms documented
- [x] Architecture phase use cases identified
- [x] Planning phase use cases identified
- [x] Code tree visualization approach defined
- [x] Refactoring diff preview approach defined
- [x] Integration patterns with AI agents documented

## Implementation Plan

1. Research MCP documentation and core concepts
2. Analyze MCP tool, resource, and prompt exposure mechanisms
3. Study existing MCP server implementations (filesystem, git)
4. Identify architecture phase use cases for Ariadne's capabilities
5. Identify planning phase use cases (refactoring preview, impact analysis)
6. Define code tree visualization approach via MCP
7. Define refactoring diff preview approach via MCP
8. Document integration patterns with AI agents
9. Create comprehensive research findings document

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken

Conducted thorough research of MCP documentation, specifications, and existing implementations to understand how AI agents can leverage tools through the protocol. Focused specifically on architecture and planning phase capabilities that would benefit from Ariadne's code intelligence features.

### Key Findings

1. **MCP Architecture**: Client-server model with hosts (AI apps), clients (connectors), and servers (tool providers)
2. **Three Core Primitives**:
   - Tools: Model-controlled functions for actions
   - Resources: Application-controlled data access
   - Prompts: User-controlled interaction templates
3. **Protocol Details**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio or HTTP+SSE transport

### Architecture Phase Use Cases Identified

- Code structure visualization via tree representations
- Dependency analysis and circular import detection
- Symbol exploration and hierarchy visualization
- Cross-file intelligence for understanding code relationships

### Planning Phase Use Cases Identified

- Refactoring preview with diff generation
- Impact analysis for proposed changes
- Code quality assessment and metrics
- Call graph analysis for execution flow understanding

### Technical Decisions

1. **Dual Approach**: Combine tools for actions and resources for browseable data
2. **Session Management**: Support both stateless and stateful operations
3. **AI-Optimized Formats**: Token-efficient representations for large codebases

### Modified Files

- Created `/Users/chuck/workspace/ariadne-2/backlog/docs/mcp-research-findings.md` - Comprehensive research documentation

### Next Steps

The research provides a solid foundation for implementing @ariadnejs/mcp with clear use cases and technical approaches defined. The parent task (task-47) can now proceed with implementation based on these findings.
