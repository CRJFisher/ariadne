## Description

Clean up all unimplemented methods and TODO comments that create confusion and make the codebase harder to understand. Many methods currently return empty results or have TODO comments that don't provide clear next steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All TODO comments addressed by either implementing functionality or converting to backlog tasks
- [ ] Unimplemented methods either properly implemented or removed entirely
- [ ] No placeholder implementations returning empty results without clear documentation
- [ ] Remaining TODOs have clear actionable descriptions and issue references
- [ ] Code review to ensure no functionality is accidentally removed
