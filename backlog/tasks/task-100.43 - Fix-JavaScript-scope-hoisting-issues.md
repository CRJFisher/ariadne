## Description

JavaScript's hoisting behavior (var declarations, function declarations) is not being handled correctly. This affects scope resolution and can lead to incorrect reference tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function declarations are hoisted correctly
- [ ] var declarations are hoisted to function scope
- [ ] let/const block scoping is respected
- [ ] Temporal dead zones are handled
