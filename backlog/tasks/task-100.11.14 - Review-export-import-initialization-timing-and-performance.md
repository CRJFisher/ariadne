## Description

Export detection and import initialization were added to add_or_update_file method to ensure imports are properly tracked for type resolution. This might have performance implications as it runs on every file update. The timing and efficiency of this initialization should be reviewed and potentially optimized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Export/import initialization performance is measured
- [ ] Initialization only runs when necessary
- [ ] No duplicate initialization occurs
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal for large projects
