## Description

Create a scalable testing pattern that ensures consistent test coverage across all supported languages. Current testing is inconsistent between languages and will become unmaintainable as more languages are added.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared test suite structure for common language features created
- [ ] Language feature matrix documenting supported features per language
- [ ] Test runner that can execute shared tests for each language
- [ ] Existing language tests refactored to use new pattern
- [ ] Documentation for adding tests for new languages
