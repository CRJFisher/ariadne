## Description

After ref_to_scope implementation, 6 JavaScript tests need updating. While low priority, these test failures could mask real issues and should be fixed for validation confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All JavaScript tests passing
- [ ] Test expectations match new behavior
- [ ] No false test failures
