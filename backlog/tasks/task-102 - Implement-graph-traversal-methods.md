## Description

The ScopeGraph class in graph.ts has several TODO comments for unimplemented methods: findAllNodesOfKind, findNodesByPredicate, getNodeAtPosition, and getNodesInRange. These methods would be useful for graph traversal and querying.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All four methods are implemented
- [ ] Methods have appropriate tests
- [ ] Methods follow existing patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Documentation is added for each method
