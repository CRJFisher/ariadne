## Description

The type registry currently doesn't handle cases where variables are reassigned to different types. This can lead to incorrect type tracking and method resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Variable reassignments update type registry
- [ ] Type tracking remains accurate after reassignment
- [ ] Tests cover reassignment scenarios
