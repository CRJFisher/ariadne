## Description

Create a separate npm package containing only TypeScript type definitions from refscope, with zero runtime code. This addresses the need for refscope types in environments where bundle size is critical (like webviews) without requiring the full refscope package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] refscope-types package published to npm with all core type definitions
- [x] Zero runtime JavaScript code - only .d.ts files
- [x] Automated extraction of types from main refscope codebase
- [x] CI/CD pipeline for publishing types package in sync with refscope releases
- [x] Type definitions include all core types (CallGraph, Definition, etc)
- [x] Package has proper versioning aligned with refscope versions
- [x] Documentation includes usage examples for both webview and extension contexts
- [x] Tests verify type definitions compile correctly

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze refscope codebase to identify all exported types and interfaces
2. Create new package structure under packages/refscope-types
3. Set up package.json with proper configuration for types-only package
4. Create type extraction script to pull types from main refscope
5. Organize extracted types into logical .d.ts files (graph, definitions, common)
6. Set up build process to generate types package from source
7. Create GitHub Action workflow for automated publishing
8. Add tests to verify type definitions compile and are usable
9. Update documentation with usage examples
10. Consider updating main refscope to optionally use types package

## Implementation Notes

Implemented the refscope-types npm package with the following:

- Created package structure under packages/refscope-types with proper package.json configuration
- Extracted and organized all TypeScript type definitions into logical .d.ts files:
  - common.d.ts: Basic types (Point, SimpleRange, Scoping, FunctionMetadata, Edit, etc.)
  - definitions.d.ts: Node types (Def, Ref, Import, Scope, FunctionCall, ImportInfo)
  - edges.d.ts: Edge types for scope graph connections
  - graph.d.ts: Call graph types (Call, CallGraph, CallGraphNode, CallGraphEdge)
- Set up TypeScript configuration with strict type checking
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify all types compile correctly
- Added GitHub Action workflow (publish-types.yml) for automated publishing on tag push
- Updated main README with documentation about the types-only package
- Package publishes with zero runtime code, only .d.ts files

The types package will be automatically published to npm when a new version tag is pushed, running in parallel with the main refscope release workflow.
