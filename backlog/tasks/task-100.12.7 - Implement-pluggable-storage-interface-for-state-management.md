## Description

Create an interface that allows library users to provide their own storage implementation for large state objects like call graphs and scope graphs. This enables users to implement custom storage strategies such as disk-based storage, database storage, or distributed caching to optimize memory usage and performance for their specific use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Storage interface is defined with methods for get set delete and clear operations
- [ ] Interface supports async operations for external storage backends
- [ ] Project class accepts optional storage provider in constructor
- [ ] Default in-memory storage implementation provided
- [ ] Call graphs can be stored and retrieved via storage interface
- [ ] Scope graphs can be stored and retrieved via storage interface
- [ ] Storage key generation is consistent and collision-free
- [ ] Unit tests verify storage interface with mock implementation
- [ ] Documentation explains how to implement custom storage providers
