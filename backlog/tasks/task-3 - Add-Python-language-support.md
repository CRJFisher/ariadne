## Description

Implement Python language support following the language configuration guide. Python is a widely-used language and would demonstrate the multi-language capabilities of the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Install tree-sitter-python parser
- [ ] Create Python language configuration
- [ ] Write comprehensive scope queries for Python
- [ ] Handle Python-specific features: indentation-based scoping
- [ ] Handle Python-specific features: class definitions and inheritance
- [ ] Handle Python-specific features: decorators
- [ ] Handle Python-specific features: import system
- [ ] Handle Python-specific features: global and nonlocal keywords
- [ ] Add full test coverage
- [ ] Update documentation

## Implementation Notes

Reference implementation sketch is already in the language configuration documentation. This will be a good test of the language abstraction. Key differences from TypeScript: indentation-based syntax, dynamic typing, different import system, special scoping rules (global, nonlocal), everything is an object.
