## Description

Epic task to drive real-world effectiveness through an iterative validation and fix process. The goal is to repeatedly run the validation process until Ariadne can accurately parse and process its own codebase, meeting all accuracy thresholds.

Current validation results show:

- Nodes with calls: 36.9% (threshold: 85%)
- Nodes called by others: 65.0% (threshold: 85%)

**Iterative Process:**

1. Run the validation guide (packages/core/agent-validation/validation-guide.md)
2. Identify specific discrepancies and failures
3. Create test cases that capture each fault
4. Create sub-tasks for each issue found
5. Fix the issues by debugging and implementing solutions
6. Once all sub-tasks are complete, re-run the validation guide
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until all thresholds are met

This iterative approach ensures we address all issues systematically and verify fixes work correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Validation passes all accuracy thresholds (nodes-with-calls: 85%+, nodes-called-by-others: 85%+)
- [ ] CI/CD validation runs without continue-on-error
- [ ] All sub-tasks completed (remaining: 100.3, 100.6, 100.9, 100.10, and re-do 100.11.14)

## Implementation Plan

**Iteration 1 (Current):**

1. ✅ Run validation guide process (task-100.5) - identified method call and file size issues
2. Create test cases for identified issues (method-call-detection.test.ts, large-file-handling.test.ts)
3. Fix identified issues through sub-tasks:
   - task-100.11: Refactor project_call_graph.ts (60KB → under 32KB) - critical for analysis
   - task-100.8: Fix incoming call detection (method calls)
   - task-100.1: Fix low nodes-with-calls percentage
   - task-100.2: Fix low nodes-called-by-others percentage
   - Other sub-tasks as needed

**Iteration 2+ (After fixes):**

1. Re-run validation guide to check improvements
2. Identify any remaining discrepancies
3. Create new test cases and sub-tasks if needed
4. Fix new issues found
5. Repeat until all thresholds are met

**Final Steps:**

- Remove continue-on-error from CI/CD validation
- Document the fixes and improvements made

Note: File size limit is resolved - index.ts reduced from 34KB to 1.4KB

## Implementation Notes

### 2025-08-05 Validation Results (Initial)

Ran validation after completing the immutable refactoring (task-100.12):

**Current Metrics:**

- Nodes with calls: 34.1% (threshold: 85%) ❌
- Nodes called by others: 37.1% (threshold: 85%) ❌
- Total functions: 334
- Total edges: 210

**Key Finding:** Built-in function calls are not being tracked. This is the primary cause of low "nodes with calls" percentage. Examples include:

- console.log() calls (very common in codebase)
- Array methods (map, filter, forEach)
- JSON methods (parse, stringify)
- Object methods (keys, values)

**Root Cause:** The implementation for tracking built-in calls (task-100.11.14) appears to be missing after the refactoring. The call analysis only tracks calls to definitions found within the project.

### 2025-08-05 Built-in Call Tracking Fix

Implemented fixes for built-in call tracking:

1. **Fixed is_reference_called AST node comparison bug** (task-100.13)
   - Object identity comparisons fail when multiple files are loaded
   - Changed to check node types instead of object identity
2. **Fixed null vs undefined check for unresolved references**

   - Changed condition to explicitly check `!resolved.resolved` and `!resolved`
   - Ensures built-in calls are created when references can't be resolved

3. **Current Status After Fixes:**
   - Built-in calls ARE being tracked in single-file and small multi-file scenarios
   - Tests pass successfully showing built-in tracking works
   - However, validation still shows low percentages (35.6% nodes with calls)
4. **Remaining Issue:**
   - When many files are loaded (as in validation), built-in calls disappear
   - Investigation shows that when new files are added, previously analyzed files are not re-analyzed
   - The call graph appears to use cached results that don't include built-in calls
   - Example: generateLargeFile starts with 19 built-in calls, but has 0 after loading more files

**Next Steps:**

1. Investigate why built-in calls are lost in large multi-file projects
2. Fix the caching/state preservation issue
3. Re-run validation to confirm improvement

The validation infrastructure is working correctly - it properly loads files, builds graphs, and tracks call relationships when they exist. The core built-in tracking logic is also correct, but there's an issue with state preservation in multi-file scenarios.

## Implementation Summary

Major refactoring completed to eliminate NavigationService and QueryService, followed by fixing critical issues with cross-file call tracking and export detection.

### Work Completed

1. **Cross-file Call Tracking (task-100.30)**: ✅ Fixed for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python

   - Enhanced export detection for CommonJS patterns
   - Added virtual file system support for testing
   - Method calls now correctly resolve across files

2. **CommonJS and ES6 Export Support (task-100.9)**: ✅ Significant progress

   - CommonJS exports via module.exports now detected
   - ES6 exports working in TypeScript files
   - Cross-file method resolution working for main languages

3. **Edge Case Analysis (task-100.33)**: ✅ Analyzed and documented
   - Identified 5 categories of edge cases needing work
   - Created detailed sub-tasks for each issue

### Test Results

- **484 tests passing** (was ~476 before)
- 8 tests failing (down from many more)
- 21 tests skipped (intentionally for future work)

### Key Fixes

- Fixed incremental parsing API usage
- Fixed large file handling (>32KB files)
- Fixed built-in method detection
- Fixed CommonJS export detection
- Fixed virtual file system resolution

### Sub-tasks Created for Remaining Work

- task-100.37: Fix Rust cross-file method resolution
- task-100.38: Add recursive/self-referential call tracking
- task-100.39: Support method chaining and return type tracking
- task-100.40: Add namespace import resolution
- task-100.41: Add graceful error handling for missing imports
- task-100.42: Fix variable reassignment type tracking
- task-100.43: Fix JavaScript scope hoisting issues
- task-100.44: Fix TypeScript TSX reference tracking
- task-100.45: Add support for .mts and .cts TypeScript extensions

### Impact

The core cross-file tracking functionality is now working for the primary use cases in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. The remaining issues are edge cases that can be addressed incrementally through the created sub-tasks.

## Task Migration Note (2025-08-06)

**This task has been reorganized into the Epic structure:**

- All sub-tasks have been migrated to appropriate epics (Type System, Import/Export, Call Graph, etc.)
- The validation process itself has been moved to `backlog/tasks/operations/agent-validation-process.md` as an ongoing operational task
- Completed sub-tasks have been archived to `backlog/tasks/epics/epic-8-completed/archived/`
- This task remains as a historical reference showing the evolution from a single epic task to the current organized structure

**See the new structure:**
- Epic organization: `/backlog/tasks/epics/`
- Operations tasks: `/backlog/tasks/operations/`
- Work priorities: `/backlog/WORK_PRIORITY.md`
