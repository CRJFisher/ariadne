## Description

Library users should be able to navigate to actual implementation code when using the library in their editors. Currently sourceMappingURL comments exist but don't provide proper navigation to source code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can navigate to implementation code from type definitions
- [ ] Source maps are properly generated and linked
- [ ] Navigation works in VS Code and other major editors
- [ ] Build process generates correct source map references
