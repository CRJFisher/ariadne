## Description

Implement cross-file method resolution for Rust, including Type::method() patterns, instance method resolution through variable type tracking, and proper filtering of private uncalled methods.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rust Type::method() pattern recognized
- [x] Instance methods resolved through type tracking
- [x] Private uncalled methods filtered out
- [x] Cross-file tests pass for Rust

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented Rust cross-file method resolution including:
- Added Rust use_declaration handling in scope_resolution.ts
- Added 'method' to Rust namespaces in languages/rust/index.ts
- Modified scopes.scm to mark Type::method() as reference.method
- Implemented Type::method() resolution in project_call_graph.ts
- Added variable type tracking for Rust let declarations
- All cross-file tests now pass for Rust
