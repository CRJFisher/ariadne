# Work Priority Guide

## Current priority

Debug Ariadne through an **iterative validation process** using `packages/core/agent-validation/validation-guide.md` as a real-world, high-level integration test. This iterative approach ensures systematic fixes until Ariadne can accurately parse itself.

**The Iterative Process:**

1. **Run validation guide** to identify discrepancies
2. **Create test cases** that capture each fault found
3. **Create sub-tasks** for each issue with clear descriptions
4. **Fix the issues** by debugging and implementing solutions
5. **Complete all sub-tasks** for the current iteration
6. **Re-run validation guide** to verify improvements
7. **Repeat** until all accuracy thresholds are met (85%+)

This cycle continues until Ariadne correctly parses and processes its own codebase.

## üö® CRITICAL - Work on this FIRST

### task-100: Improve Ariadne self-analysis accuracy (EPIC)

Epic task implementing the iterative validation process to meet accuracy thresholds:

- **Current metrics**: nodes-with-calls 40.8% (need 85%), nodes-called-by-others 52.2% (need 85%)
- **Iteration 1 findings**: Method calls not detected, file size limit causing skipped files
- **Active sub-tasks**: task-100.3, task-100.6, task-100.9, task-100.10, task-100.12 (focusing on validation and file size issues)
- **Process**: Fix sub-tasks ‚Üí Re-run validation ‚Üí Create new sub-tasks if needed ‚Üí Repeat
- **Goal**: Achieve 85%+ accuracy through iterative improvements

### task-100.12: Refactor Project class to be immutable (EPIC)

Critical sub-task to address index.ts exceeding 32KB limit (currently 34KB):

- **Problem**: index.ts cannot be analyzed by Ariadne due to file size
- **Solution**: Split Project class into smaller modules with immutable architecture
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - task-100.12.1: Design storage interface
  - task-100.12.2: Extract file management
  - task-100.12.3: Extract navigation logic
  - task-100.12.4: Extract call graph operations
  - task-100.12.5: Implement in-memory storage
  - task-100.12.6: Make Project immutable
  - task-100.12.7: Pluggable storage providers

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY

### task-101: Test Ariadne-MCP integration with Claude Code

- Real-world validation by integrating ariadne-mcp as an MCP server
- Claude Code will use Ariadne for code exploration workflows
- Validates accuracy by comparing with grep/find results
- Ensures Ariadne provides practical value for AI-assisted development

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important but not blocking

*All medium priority issues have been resolved!*

## üìö DOCUMENTATION

### task-83: Document import/export patterns

- Wait until implementation is stable
- Document all supported patterns for each language

### task-84: Generic validation script for external repos

- Create reusable validation script
- Test on multiple open-source projects
