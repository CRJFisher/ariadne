# Work Priority Guide

## Current priority

Debug Ariadne through an **iterative validation process** using `packages/core/agent-validation/validation-guide.md` as a real-world, high-level integration test. This iterative approach ensures systematic fixes until Ariadne can accurately parse itself.

**The Iterative Process:**

1. **Run validation guide** to identify discrepancies
2. **Create test cases** that capture each fault found
3. **Create sub-tasks** for each issue with clear descriptions
4. **Fix the issues** by debugging and implementing solutions
5. **Complete all sub-tasks** for the current iteration
6. **Re-run validation guide** to verify improvements
7. **Repeat** until all accuracy thresholds are met (85%+)

This cycle continues until Ariadne correctly parses and processes its own codebase.

## üö® CRITICAL - Work on this FIRST

### task-100: Improve Ariadne self-analysis accuracy (EPIC)

Epic task implementing the iterative validation process to meet accuracy thresholds:

- **Current metrics (2025-08-05)**: nodes-with-calls 34.7% (need 85%), nodes-called-by-others 37.1% (need 85%)
- **Latest finding**: Built-in tracking exists but fails in multi-file projects (works 100% single file, 48.5% multi-file)
- **URGENT**: task-100.13 - Fix critical multi-file bug in built-in tracking
- **Active sub-tasks**: task-100.13 (urgent bug), task-100.11.14, task-100.3, task-100.6, task-100.9, task-100.10
- **Process**: Fix sub-tasks ‚Üí Re-run validation ‚Üí Create new sub-tasks if needed ‚Üí Repeat
- **Goal**: Achieve 85%+ accuracy through iterative improvements

### ‚úÖ task-100.12: Refactor Project class to be immutable (COMPLETED)

Successfully addressed index.ts exceeding 32KB limit:

- **Problem**: index.ts was 34KB and couldn't be analyzed
- **Solution**: Split into modules with immutable architecture
- **Result**: index.ts reduced to 1.4KB (96% reduction)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Immutable state management with transactions
  - Pluggable storage backends (memory, disk, etc.)
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Full backward compatibility (then removed for cleaner API)

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY

### task-101: Test Ariadne-MCP integration with Claude Code

- Real-world validation by integrating ariadne-mcp as an MCP server
- Claude Code will use Ariadne for code exploration workflows
- Validates accuracy by comparing with grep/find results
- Ensures Ariadne provides practical value for AI-assisted development

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important but not blocking

*All medium priority issues have been resolved!*

## üìö DOCUMENTATION

### task-83: Document import/export patterns

- Wait until implementation is stable
- Document all supported patterns for each language

### task-84: Generic validation script for external repos

- Create reusable validation script
- Test on multiple open-source projects
