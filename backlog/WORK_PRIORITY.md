# Work Priority 🎯

## Current Focus: Release v0.5.18

### Release Status 🚀

**Ready for Release!** The codebase is stable and tests are passing.

#### Test Status

- **500 passing** ✅ (up from 387)
- **0 failing** ✅ (namespace imports now implemented!)
- **21 skipped** ⏭️ (edge cases and enhancements)

#### Validation Results

- Successfully analyzes own codebase (341 functions, 372 calls)
- Core API methods working but not detected in validation (needs script update)
- Cross-file tracking operational for all main languages

### Pre-Release Checklist ✅

1. **Test Suite** ✅

   - Fixed missing import in test_utils.ts
   - All regression tests passing
   - Namespace imports now implemented and working
   - 500 tests passing (96% pass rate)

2. **Code Quality** ✅

   - Major refactoring complete (NavigationService eliminated)
   - Task reorganization into 10 epics
   - All critical bugs fixed and archived
   - Started folder structure migration (namespace imports migrated)

3. **Documentation** 🔧
   - Need to update README with current limitations
   - Need to document remaining unimplemented features

### Known Limitations (Document These)

1. **Method Chaining** - Not yet supported (task-100.39)
2. **Return Type Inference** - Limited support
3. **File Size** - Files >32KB need splitting (tree-sitter limit)

### Release Actions

1. **Immediate**

   - Update package version to 0.5.18
   - Document known limitations in README
   - Create release notes highlighting improvements

2. **Release Notes Content**
   - ✅ Cross-file call tracking fixed for all languages
   - ✅ CommonJS and ES6 export support improved
   - ✅ Virtual file system support for testing
   - ✅ Import resolution more robust
   - ✅ **Namespace imports implemented** (partial support for JS/TS)
   - ✅ Started migration to new folder structure
   - ✅ 500 tests passing (96% pass rate)

## Post-Release Priorities

### Immediate Priority: Information Architecture Overhaul 🏗️

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Create validation scripts for feature coverage
- Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns
- Create migration tracking system
- Select pilot features for migration

**Phase 2: Pilot Migration (Week 2-3)**
- Complete namespace imports migration (already started)
- Migrate method chaining feature
- Migrate return type analysis
- Document patterns learned

**Phase 3: Documentation Update (Week 3)**
- Archive old documentation
- Create ARCHITECTURE.md, FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT.md, LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md
- Update rules files with migration guidelines

### High Priority Epics 🔴

1. **Epic 9: Test Suite Maintenance**
   - Split oversized test files (51KB and 41KB)
   - Critical for preventing future test failures
   - Aligns with new folder structure

2. **Epic 1: Type System & Inference**
   - Would enable method chaining and better resolution
   - Migrate to type_system/ category during overhaul

3. **Epic 4: Performance & Scalability**
   - Handle files >32KB properly
   - Optimize for large codebases

### Medium Priority Epics 🟡

4. **Epic 10: Language Expansion Framework**
   - Build matrix framework first
   - Aligns perfectly with new architecture pattern
   - Then add 7 new languages systematically

## Epic Structure Summary

**10 Total Epics:**

- 3 HIGH priority (Type System, Performance, Test Maintenance)
- 5 MEDIUM priority (Import/Export, MCP, Call Graph, Documentation, Language Expansion)
- 1 LOW priority (Language Edge Cases)
- 1 COMPLETED (Bug Fixes - archived)

## Success Metrics

- **Current Release:** 96% test pass rate ✅
- **Next Milestone Goals (Post-Architecture Overhaul):**
  - Complete information architecture migration
  - 100% test pass rate
  - Method chaining support
  - All test files <32KB
  - Feature coverage validation in CI/CD
  - Test contracts for all universal features

## Weekly Process

1. **Monday:** Review epic progress
2. **Daily:** Focus on highest priority tasks
3. **Friday:** Run validation, update metrics

## Notes

- The project is stable and ready for release (500 tests passing!)
- Namespace imports successfully implemented during recent work
- Post-release focus: Information Architecture Overhaul as per INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
- Apply feature→language→testing pattern to all new development
- Migration will enable better language support and feature discovery
