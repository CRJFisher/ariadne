# Work Priority Guide

## Current priority

Debug ariadne by running the `packages/core/agent-validation/validation-guide.md` process which is essentially a real-world, high-level integration test. Fixing the errors here will give us confidence that the code is working as expected. This will involve:

- When we see discrepancies between the expected and actual results, we should add test cases which capture the faults.
- We should create tasks which reference the new test cases and describe the faults.
- We should then fix the faults to pass the test cases.

## üö® CRITICAL - Work on this FIRST

### task-100: Improve Ariadne self-analysis accuracy (EPIC)

Epic task to meet validation thresholds through the validation-guide.md process:

- Current: nodes-with-calls 36.9% (need 85%), nodes-called-by-others 65% (need 85%)
- Sub-tasks: task-100.1 through task-100.10 (10 total)
- Goal: Fix discrepancies to achieve real-world effectiveness

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY

*All high priority issues have been resolved!*

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important but not blocking

*All medium priority issues have been resolved!*

## üìö DOCUMENTATION

### task-83: Document import/export patterns

- Wait until implementation is stable
- Document all supported patterns for each language

### task-84: Generic validation script for external repos

- Create reusable validation script
- Test on multiple open-source projects

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Completed Recently** (2025-08-04):

*Note: Several parsing/accuracy tasks (88, 90, 71, 72, 99) were consolidated into epic task-100*

- Add validation test to CI/CD pipeline (task-92)
- Add edge case tests for cross-file resolution (task-82)
- Handle variable reassignments in type registry (task-81)
- Fix hoisted variable reference resolution (task-100 - old, archived)
- Fix missing ref_to_scope edges (task-97)
- Update JavaScript/TypeScript tests for ref_to_scope (task-98)
- Fix duplicate call tracking (task-73)
- Fix call graph test failures (task-75)
- Fix top-level node detection (task-76)
- Fix remaining test suite failures (task-77)
- Fix cross-file call tracking (task-87)
- Fix function over-counting (task-89)
- Fix exported function tracking (task-91)
- Fix TypeScript interface counting (task-93)
- Add comprehensive import/export tests (task-80)
- Fix JavaScript reference detection investigation (task-96)
- Rust crate:: path resolution (task-29)
- Implement proper module path resolution (task-28)
- Fix get_all_functions to handle methods (task-78)
- Add cross-file method resolution for imported classes (task-64)

‚úÖ **Previously Completed** (2025-08-03):

- Rust cross-file method resolution (task-86)
- File-level variable type tracking (task-65)
- Constructor type tracking (task-66)
- Python self parameter tracking (task-70)
- Cross-file method resolution for imported classes (task-64)

üöß **In Progress**:

- task-100: Improve self-analysis accuracy (EPIC) - 10 subtasks
- task-62: Agent validation issues (being completed in task-100.3)
- task-67: Cross-file type registry for method resolution

‚ùå **Blocked**:

- task-74: File size limit - duplicate of task-60
- task-60: Handle tree-sitter 32KB limit - waiting for response

## Key Achievements

1. **Cross-file Resolution**: Now works for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Rust
2. **Import Resolution**: Fixed TypeScript/JavaScript imports and Rust crate:: paths
3. **Function Counting**: Fixed double-counting and export detection
4. **Test Coverage**: Added 16 comprehensive import/export tests

## Next Steps

1. **Run validation guide process** (task-100.5) - identify specific discrepancies
2. **Fix incoming call detection** (task-100.8) - critical for metrics
3. **Fix nodes-with-calls issues** (task-100.1) - major metric gap
4. **Fix nodes-called-by-others** (task-100.2) - major metric gap
5. **Fix import counting** (task-100.7) - affects file summaries
6. Complete remaining subtasks in priority order
