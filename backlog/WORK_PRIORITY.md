# Work Priority 🎯

## Current Focus: Release v0.5.18

### Release Status 🚀

**Ready for Release!** The codebase is stable and tests are passing.

#### Test Status
- **387 passing** ✅ (up from 383)
- **2 failing** 🔧 (unimplemented features - not regressions)
- **17 skipped** ⏭️ (edge cases and enhancements)

#### Validation Results
- Successfully analyzes own codebase (341 functions, 372 calls)
- Core API methods working but not detected in validation (needs script update)
- Cross-file tracking operational for all main languages

### Pre-Release Checklist ✅

1. **Test Suite** ✅
   - Fixed missing import in test_utils.ts
   - All regression tests passing
   - Only 2 failures are for unimplemented features (namespace imports, method chaining)

2. **Code Quality** ✅
   - Major refactoring complete (NavigationService eliminated)
   - Task reorganization into 10 epics
   - All critical bugs fixed and archived

3. **Documentation** 🔧
   - Need to update README with current limitations
   - Need to document the 2 known unimplemented features

### Known Limitations (Document These)

1. **Method Chaining** - Not yet supported (task-100.39)
2. **Namespace Imports** - Not yet supported (task-100.40)
3. **Return Type Inference** - Limited support
4. **File Size** - Files >32KB need splitting (tree-sitter limit)

### Release Actions

1. **Immediate**
   - Update package version to 0.5.18
   - Document known limitations in README
   - Create release notes highlighting improvements

2. **Release Notes Content**
   - ✅ Cross-file call tracking fixed for all languages
   - ✅ CommonJS and ES6 export support improved
   - ✅ Virtual file system support for testing
   - ✅ Import resolution more robust
   - ✅ 387 tests passing (95% pass rate)

## Post-Release Priorities

### High Priority Epics 🔴

1. **Epic 9: Test Suite Maintenance**
   - Split oversized test files (51KB and 41KB)
   - Critical for preventing future test failures

2. **Epic 1: Type System & Inference**
   - Would enable method chaining and better resolution
   - Addresses one of the two failing tests

3. **Epic 4: Performance & Scalability**
   - Handle files >32KB properly
   - Optimize for large codebases

### Medium Priority Epics 🟡

4. **Epic 2: Import/Export Resolution**
   - Namespace imports (addresses other failing test)
   - .mts/.cts TypeScript extensions

5. **Epic 10: Language Expansion Framework**
   - Build matrix framework first
   - Then add 7 new languages systematically

## Epic Structure Summary

**10 Total Epics:**
- 3 HIGH priority (Type System, Performance, Test Maintenance)
- 5 MEDIUM priority (Import/Export, MCP, Call Graph, Documentation, Language Expansion)
- 1 LOW priority (Language Edge Cases)
- 1 COMPLETED (Bug Fixes - archived)

## Success Metrics

- **Current Release:** 95% test pass rate ✅
- **Next Release Goals:**
  - 100% test pass rate
  - Method chaining support
  - Namespace imports support
  - All test files <32KB

## Weekly Process

1. **Monday:** Review epic progress
2. **Daily:** Focus on highest priority tasks
3. **Friday:** Run validation, update metrics

## Notes

- The project is stable and ready for release
- Focus post-release on the two failing test features
- Apply `@rules/refactoring.md` to all changes
- Track progress in epic README files
