## Description

The type registry currently doesn't handle cases where variables are reassigned to different types. This can lead to incorrect type tracking and method resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Variable reassignments update type registry
- [x] Type tracking remains accurate after reassignment
- [x] Tests cover reassignment scenarios

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify where reassignments are processed (assignment_expression nodes)
2. Add logic to detect reassignments and update the type registry
3. Consider the position of reassignments - later reassignments should override earlier types
4. Add tests for various reassignment scenarios (same type, different type, multiple reassignments)
5. Test with different languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust)

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented position-aware variable type tracking to handle reassignments.

### Problem
The type registry was overwriting variable types on reassignment, applying the new type to ALL references rather than just those after the reassignment.

### Solution
1. Modified FileTypeTracker and LocalTypeTracker to store type information with position data
2. Types are now stored as arrays sorted by position (row, column)
3. When resolving a variable type, we find the most recent assignment before the reference position
4. This ensures that references before a reassignment use the original type, and references after use the new type

### Implementation Details
- Updated variableTypes to store arrays of type info with positions
- Modified setVariableType() to accept and store position information
- Updated getVariableType() to accept position and return the correct type for that position
- Updated all setVariableType calls to include assignment position
- Updated method reference resolution to pass reference position when looking up types

### Results
- Variable reassignments now correctly update type tracking
- Type resolution is position-aware - references use the type that was assigned most recently before their position
- Multiple reassignments are handled correctly
- Tests confirm proper behavior with various reassignment scenarios

### Files Modified
- packages/core/src/project_call_graph.ts: Implemented position-aware type tracking
- packages/core/tests/reassignment.test.ts: Added basic reassignment test
- packages/core/tests/reassignment-comprehensive.test.ts: Added comprehensive tests
