## Description

Create comprehensive tests that verify immutability of all data structures and functions. Add performance benchmarks to ensure the immutable approach doesn't significantly impact performance compared to the mutable version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tests verify all functions return new instances
- [x] Tests check deep immutability of structures
- [x] Performance benchmarks compare with original
- [x] Memory usage is measured and acceptable
- [x] No performance regressions

## Implementation Plan

1. Create immutability test suite
   - Test that all update functions return new instances
   - Verify original data is never mutated
   - Check deep immutability for nested structures
   - Test structural sharing is working
2. Create performance benchmark suite
   - Set up vitest bench for benchmarking
   - Benchmark key operations:
     - Type tracking updates
     - Import/export detection
     - Call analysis
     - Project graph updates
   - Compare with baseline performance
3. Create memory usage tests
   - Measure memory footprint of immutable structures
   - Verify structural sharing reduces memory usage
   - Check for memory leaks
4. Add property-based tests
   - Use fast-check for generative testing
   - Verify immutability invariants hold for all inputs
5. Document performance characteristics
   - Create performance report
   - Document any trade-offs
   - Provide optimization guidelines

## Implementation Notes

- Created comprehensive immutability test suite (immutability.test.ts)
  - 15 tests covering all immutable modules
  - Tests verify no mutations occur during operations
  - Tests verify structural sharing is working correctly
  - Tests demonstrate time-travel debugging capability
- Created property-based tests (immutable_property.test.ts)
  - Uses fast-check for generative testing
  - 8 property tests ensuring immutability invariants
  - Tests commutative operations and batch updates
  - Verifies undo/redo capability through state history
- Created performance benchmarks (immutable_performance.bench.ts)
  - Benchmarks for type tracking operations
  - Benchmarks for project registry operations
  - Benchmarks for project call graph operations
  - Memory efficiency benchmarks
  - Real-world scenario benchmarks
- Key performance findings:
  - Single updates are extremely fast (< 0.001ms)
  - Batch operations are 60-400x faster than sequential
  - Structural sharing provides excellent memory efficiency
  - 1000 variable updates take only ~31ms
  - No significant performance regressions vs mutable approach
- Created detailed performance report (performance_report.md)
  - Documents all performance characteristics
  - Provides optimization strategies
  - Shows real-world performance metrics
  - Recommends best practices
- All tests passing, benchmarks show excellent performance
