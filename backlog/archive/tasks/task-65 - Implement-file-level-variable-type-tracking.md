## Description

Refactor variable type tracking to persist at the file level rather than function level. Currently, type information is lost between function calls because variableTypes map is local to get_calls_from_definition(). This is the first step to enable cross-file method resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Variable types tracked at file scope
- [x] Type information persists across function boundaries within same file
- [x] Existing same-file method resolution continues to work
- [x] Tests verify type persistence across functions
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a FileTypeTracker class to manage type information per file
2. Store FileTypeTracker instances in ProjectCallGraph class as a Map<string, FileTypeTracker>
3. Refactor get_calls_from_definition to use FileTypeTracker instead of local variableTypes
4. Update type tracking logic to store types at file level
5. Ensure type information persists across multiple function analyses
6. Add tests for cross-function type persistence
7. Verify existing same-file tests still pass

## Implementation Notes

Implemented FileTypeTracker class to manage variable type information at the file level. Key changes:

1. Created FileTypeTracker class in project_call_graph.ts with methods to set/get variable types
2. Added file_type_trackers Map to ProjectCallGraph to store FileTypeTracker per file
3. Refactored get_calls_from_definition to use FileTypeTracker instead of local variableTypes map
4. Added clearFileTypeTracker method called when files are updated
5. Added test case verifying type persistence across variable scopes in same file

The implementation enables type information to persist across function boundaries within the same file, laying the foundation for more advanced type tracking. However, it doesn't yet support tracking types through function returns or parameters (that's task 68).
