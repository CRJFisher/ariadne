## Description

Research and document TypeScript immutability best practices, then review and update our immutable modules to ensure they follow these patterns. This includes proper use of readonly modifiers, immutable data structures, and functional programming patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document TypeScript immutability best practices
- [x] Review existing immutable modules for compliance
- [x] Identify areas needing improvement
- [x] Update code to follow best practices
- [x] Add documentation on patterns used

## Notes

**PRIORITY**: This research should be completed before continuing with task-100.11.6 and task-100.11.7 to ensure we don't need to make significant changes later. While we've already implemented immutable patterns in tasks 100.11.1 through 100.11.5, it's important to validate our approach against TypeScript best practices.

Key areas to research:

- TypeScript's readonly modifiers (readonly arrays, ReadonlyMap, ReadonlySet)
- Const assertions and as const
- DeepReadonly utility types
- Immutable update patterns (spread operators, Object.freeze)
- Popular immutability libraries (Immer, Immutable.js) and whether we should use them
- Performance implications of our current approach
- Type inference with immutable structures

## Implementation Notes

- Created comprehensive documentation of TypeScript immutability patterns (typescript_immutability_patterns.md)
- Reviewed all immutable modules and found implementation already follows most best practices (8/10 score)
- Created immutability_review.md documenting current state and areas for improvement
- Implemented improvements:
  - Created immutable_types.ts with DeepReadonly utility type and helpers
  - Updated type interfaces to have fully readonly properties
  - Fixed one non-readonly array return type in immutable_call_analysis.ts
  - Created constants.ts with const assertions for configuration values
  - Created IMMUTABILITY_GUIDELINES.md for team reference
- Key findings:
  - Our two-phase approach (analysis then construction) is excellent
  - Structural sharing is already well implemented
  - Main improvements were minor type refinements
  - No architectural changes needed
- The immutable modules are now fully compliant with TypeScript best practices
