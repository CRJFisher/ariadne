## Description

Implement JavaScript language support as the foundational language for the system. JavaScript/TypeScript share similar syntax and this will establish the baseline language configuration patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Install tree-sitter-javascript parser
- [x] Create JavaScript language configuration
- [x] Write comprehensive scope queries for JavaScript
- [x] Handle JavaScript-specific features: var/let/const scoping
- [x] Handle JavaScript-specific features: function declarations and expressions
- [x] Handle JavaScript-specific features: arrow functions
- [x] Handle JavaScript-specific features: module imports/exports
- [x] Handle JavaScript-specific features: prototype-based inheritance
- [x] Add full test coverage
- [ ] Update documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. Install tree-sitter-javascript parser dependency
2. Study existing TypeScript language configuration as reference
3. Create JavaScript language configuration file
4. Write scope queries for all JavaScript constructs
5. Implement tests for each scoping scenario
6. Test with real-world JavaScript files
7. Update documentation

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented JavaScript language support with the following:

- Installed tree-sitter-javascript parser via npm
- Created JavaScript language configuration in src/languages/javascript/index.ts
- Copied comprehensive scope queries from bloop server's scopes.scm
- Registered JavaScript language in the main Project class
- Added extensive test coverage for all JavaScript features including:
  - Variable declarations (var, let, const) and scoping rules
  - Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
  - ES6 imports and exports
  - Classes and inheritance
  - Destructuring and spread operators
  - Control flow (loops, conditionals, labels)
  - JSX elements
  - Operators and expressions
  - Closures and hoisting
  
The scope queries handle CommonJS require() imports as well as ES6 modules. Private class fields and other modern JavaScript features are also supported.

Files created/modified:
- src/languages/javascript/index.ts
- src/languages/javascript/scopes.scm
- src/languages/javascript/javascript.test.ts
- src/index.ts (added JavaScript registration)
- package.json (added tree-sitter-javascript dependency)

Note: Documentation update is still pending.
