## Description

Create an interface that allows library users to provide their own storage implementation for large state objects like call graphs and scope graphs. This enables users to implement custom storage strategies such as disk-based storage, database storage, or distributed caching to optimize memory usage and performance for their specific use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Storage interface is defined with methods for get set delete and clear operations
- [x] Interface supports async operations for external storage backends
- [x] Project class accepts optional storage provider in constructor
- [x] Default in-memory storage implementation provided
- [x] Call graphs can be stored and retrieved via storage interface
- [x] Scope graphs can be stored and retrieved via storage interface
- [x] Storage key generation is consistent and collision-free
- [x] Unit tests verify storage interface with mock implementation
- [x] Documentation explains how to implement custom storage providers

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing storage interface implementation
2. Verify async storage support
3. Update Project/ImmutableProject to accept storage provider
4. Document storage provider implementation
5. Create example custom storage provider
6. Add comprehensive tests

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented pluggable storage interface:

1. **Storage Interface** (already implemented in previous tasks):
   - `StorageInterface` for async operations
   - `StorageInterfaceSync` for sync operations
   - `SyncToAsyncStorageAdapter` to bridge between them
   - Full transaction support

2. **Storage Provider System**:
   - `registerStorageProvider()` to register custom providers
   - `createStorage()` factory function
   - `storageProviders` registry Map
   - Default 'memory' provider auto-registered

3. **ImmutableProject Integration**:
   - Constructor accepts optional storage parameter
   - Defaults to InMemoryStorage if none provided
   - All state operations go through storage interface

4. **Example Disk Storage Provider** (`storage/examples/disk_storage.ts`):
   - Demonstrates file-based storage to reduce memory usage
   - Stores metadata and file data separately
   - Uses hashing for consistent file naming
   - Full transaction support
   - Auto-registered as 'disk' provider

5. **Documentation** (`docs/custom-storage-providers.md`):
   - Complete guide for implementing custom providers
   - Covers both async and sync interfaces
   - SQLite example implementation
   - Performance considerations
   - Best practices and common patterns

6. **Tests** (`tests/storage_interface.test.ts`):
   - Provider registration and creation
   - Custom storage with mock implementation
   - Transaction support verification
   - Disk storage provider integration test
   - All 8 tests passing

7. **Key Features**:
   - Pluggable architecture supports any backend
   - Async support for remote/slow storage
   - Transaction support for atomic updates
   - Consistent key generation
   - Type-safe interfaces
   - Backward compatible
