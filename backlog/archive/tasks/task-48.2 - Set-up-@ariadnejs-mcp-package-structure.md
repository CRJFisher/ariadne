## Description

Create the initial package structure for @ariadnejs/mcp including package.json, TypeScript configuration, and basic project setup following the monorepo patterns used by other Ariadne packages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Package directory created under packages/mcp
- [ ] package.json configured with correct name and dependencies
- [ ] TypeScript configuration set up
- [ ] Basic directory structure created (src/ and tests/)
- [ ] Package integrated with monorepo build system

## Implementation Plan

1. Create package directory structure under packages/mcp
2. Set up package.json with appropriate dependencies
3. Configure TypeScript for the package
4. Create README and LICENSE files
5. Update monorepo build configuration

## Implementation Notes

Successfully set up the @ariadnejs/mcp package structure following the monorepo patterns. Created package.json with MCP SDK and Ariadne dependencies, TypeScript configuration extending root config, and comprehensive README documentation. Package is integrated with the monorepo build system.
