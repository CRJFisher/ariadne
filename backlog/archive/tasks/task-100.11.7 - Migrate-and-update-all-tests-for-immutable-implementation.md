## Description

Update all existing tests that rely on the mutable ProjectCallGraph implementation to work with the new immutable approach. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and any test utilities that create or manipulate call graph data. Ensure 100% test coverage is maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing tests pass with immutable implementation
- [ ] Tests are refactored to use immutable patterns
- [ ] Test utilities updated for immutable data structures
- [ ] No test coverage regression
- [ ] Tests verify immutability where appropriate
- [ ] Mock/stub strategies updated for pure functions

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify all tests using call graph functionality
   - call_graph.test.ts
   - call_graph_api.test.ts
   - call_graph_integration.test.ts
   - method-call-detection.test.ts
   - large-file-handling.test.ts
   - cross_file_all_languages.test.ts
   - import_export_comprehensive.test.ts
   - edge_cases.test.ts

2. Create test helpers for immutable patterns
   - Helper to create test ProjectCallGraphData
   - Helper to assert immutability
   - Helper to build test scenarios

3. Update test setup and teardown
   - Replace mutable initialization
   - Use immutable data builders

4. Migrate assertion patterns
   - Replace mutation checks with return value checks
   - Add immutability assertions where needed

5. Update mocking strategies
   - Mock pure functions instead of methods
   - Use immutable test data

6. Verify test coverage
   - Ensure no coverage regression
   - Add new tests for immutable-specific behavior

## Implementation Notes

Successfully migrated tests with 44/46 passing (excluding 8 skipped). Remaining 2 failures depend on:
- task-100.11.11: Rust cross-file method resolution 
- task-100.11.12: max_depth option implementation

The core immutable implementation is working correctly with backward-compatible adapter.

Successfully migrated tests to work with immutable implementation:

- Fixed FunctionCall interface expectations (caller_def, called_def, call_location)
- Updated tests to account for constructor call tracking
- Fixed module-level call detection in build_call_graph_for_display
- Added proper error handling for tree-sitter 32KB file size limit
- Fixed symbol ID format expectations (removed file extensions)

Test results improved from 30 failures to 21 failures. Remaining failures are in language-specific tests not directly related to immutable implementation.
