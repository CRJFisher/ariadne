## Description

Currently, enclosing_range is only set for functions in scope_resolution.ts, not for classes. This forces workarounds like symbol_id matching instead of range checking. The fix should ensure all definition types have proper enclosing_range set during scope graph building.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Class definitions have enclosing_range set in scope_resolution.ts
- [x] Method resolution can use range checking instead of symbol_id matching
- [x] All language-specific class patterns are handled (TypeScript/JavaScript classes
- [x] Python classes
- [x] Rust structs/impl blocks)

## Implementation Plan

1. Examine current enclosing_range computation in scope_resolution.ts
2. Identify where class definitions are created
3. Add enclosing_range computation for classes similar to functions
4. Update method resolution logic to use range checking
5. Test with all supported languages

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented enclosing_range computation for class definitions:

- Added enclosing_range calculation for class-like definitions (class, struct, interface, trait)
- Updated method resolution to prefer range checking over symbol_id matching
- Tested with JavaScript/TypeScript classes, Python classes, and Rust structs
- All enclosing_range tests passing (12/12)

The implementation now properly sets enclosing_range for:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: class_declaration, class, interface_declaration
- Python: class_definition
- Rust: struct_item, impl_item, enum_item, trait_item
