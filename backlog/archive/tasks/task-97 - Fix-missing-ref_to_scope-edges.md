# task-97 - Fix missing ref_to_scope edges causing references to not be attached to scopes

## Description

References in the scope graph are not being attached to their containing scopes. The `ref_to_scope` edge type exists but no such edges are being created during graph construction. This causes all references to appear as "floating" and makes it impossible for tools to determine which scope a reference belongs to.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] References are properly attached to their containing scope via ref_to_scope edges
- [x] Test utility can properly filter references by scope
- [x] References appear in the correct scope in debug output

## Implementation Plan

1. Investigate where scope graph edges are created
2. Find where references are added to the graph
3. Add logic to create ref_to_scope edges when references are added
4. Test that references are properly attached to scopes
5. Verify that test utility now properly filters references by scope

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented ref_to_scope edges to attach references to their containing scopes.

### Problem
- References were added to the scope graph but never attached to their containing scope
- No `ref_to_scope` edges were being created
- This caused all orphaned references to appear at root level in test output
- JavaScript and TypeScript tests were failing because references appeared in wrong scopes

### Solution
1. **Added RefToScope edge type** to types package:
   - Added interface `RefToScope extends BaseEdge`
   - Added to Edge union type

2. **Modified insert_ref method** in graph.ts:
   - Already had `local_scope_id` from `find_containing_scope(ref.range)`
   - Added line to create ref_to_scope edge: `this.edges.push({ kind: 'ref_to_scope', source_id: ref.id, target_id: local_scope_id })`

3. **Updated test utility** to filter references by scope:
   - Modified `scope_refs` filter to check if reference belongs to current scope
   - Uses `ref_to_scope` edges to determine scope membership
   - Only includes orphaned references that belong to the current scope

### Results
- References now correctly appear in their containing scopes
- JavaScript tests: 4/10 now passing (was 0/10)
- TypeScript tests: 4/4 now passing (was 3/4)
- References to built-in globals (console, document) appear in correct scopes
