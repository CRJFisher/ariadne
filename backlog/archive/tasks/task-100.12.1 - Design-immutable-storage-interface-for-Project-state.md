## Description

Design the interface that will abstract all mutable state from the Project class. This interface should support both in-memory and persistent storage backends like SQLite.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] StorageInterface defined with get/set/update methods
- [x] Support for async operations
- [x] Key generation strategy defined
- [x] Interface supports transactions
- [x] TypeScript types are well-defined

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current Project class state
2. Design async storage interface
3. Design sync storage interface for easier migration
4. Create utility functions for immutable updates
5. Define transaction semantics

## Implementation Notes

Successfully designed the storage interface with the following components:

1. **storage_interface.ts**: Main async storage interface
   - ProjectState type containing all mutable state
   - StorageInterface with async methods for state management
   - StorageTransaction for atomic operations
   - Storage provider registry for pluggable implementations

2. **storage_interface_sync.ts**: Synchronous version for easier migration
   - StorageInterfaceSync with synchronous methods
   - SyncToAsyncStorageAdapter to bridge sync/async implementations
   - Enables gradual migration from current synchronous code

3. **storage_utils.ts**: Utility functions for immutable updates
   - createEmptyState: Initialize empty project state
   - updateFileInState: Immutably add/update file data
   - removeFileFromState: Immutably remove file data
   - updateInheritanceInState: Update inheritance relationships
   - deepFreeze: Ensure immutability in development

Key design decisions:
- Separated async and sync interfaces for flexibility
- Transaction support for atomic operations
- Immutable state updates using spread operators and new Maps
- Storage provider registry for extensibility
- File-level granularity for updates to optimize performance
