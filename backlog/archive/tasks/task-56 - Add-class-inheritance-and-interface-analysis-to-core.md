## Description

Add APIs to analyze class inheritance chains (extends) and interface implementations. This would enable MCP tools to provide complete class relationship information including parent classes, implemented interfaces, and inheritance hierarchies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] API to get parent class for a class definition
- [x] API to get implemented interfaces for a class
- [x] API to find all classes extending a given class
- [x] API to find all classes implementing a given interface
- [x] Tests for inheritance analysis across languages

## Implementation Plan

1. Research how class inheritance is represented in tree-sitter ASTs for each language
2. Design new API methods on the Project class for inheritance analysis
3. Extract parent class information from class definitions
4. Extract implemented interfaces from class definitions
5. Build reverse lookup indexes for efficient querying
6. Add comprehensive tests covering TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6), Python, and Java-like languages
7. Update MCP get_symbol_context to use the new APIs

## Implementation Notes

Implemented a comprehensive class inheritance analysis system for Ariadne core:

**Approach taken:**

- Created a separate inheritance map storing ClassRelationship objects instead of modifying the Def interface
- Extract inheritance information on-demand from cached AST rather than during initial parsing
- Support inheritance patterns across TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Rust

**Features implemented:**

- Created `inheritance.ts` module with `extract_class_relationships()` function
- Added 5 new API methods to Project class:
  - `get_class_relationships()`: Get parent class and interfaces for a class
  - `find_subclasses()`: Find all classes extending a parent
  - `find_implementations()`: Find all classes implementing an interface
  - `get_inheritance_chain()`: Get full inheritance hierarchy
  - `is_subclass_of()`: Check inheritance relationship
- Language-specific extraction for:
  - TypeScript: extends/implements clauses with type_identifier
  - JavaScript: direct extends pattern in class_heritage
  - Python: superclasses in argument_list
  - Rust: trait implementations via impl blocks

**Technical decisions:**

- Store inheritance data separately to keep Def interface clean (only affects classes)
- Lazy extraction using cached AST for performance
- Support both TypeScript-style (extends_clause node) and JavaScript-style (direct extends keyword) patterns

**Files modified/added:**

- `/packages/core/src/inheritance.ts` (new)
- `/packages/core/src/index.ts` (modified - added inheritance APIs and struct support)
- `/packages/core/tests/inheritance.test.ts` (new - 17 comprehensive tests)

All tests pass across TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Rust inheritance patterns. Added support for Rust structs (symbol_kind: "struct") and trait implementations.
