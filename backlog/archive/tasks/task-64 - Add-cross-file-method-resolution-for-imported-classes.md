## Description

Currently, method calls on instances of imported classes are not resolved correctly in the call graph. When a class is imported from another file and instantiated, subsequent method calls on that instance are not linked to the method definitions in the original class. This causes methods to incorrectly appear as top-level nodes in the call graph.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Method references are captured by tree-sitter queries
- [x] Method resolution works for classes defined in the same file
- [ ] Method resolution works for imported classes (requires more complex type tracking)
- [x] Tests demonstrate current capabilities and limitations
- [x] Solution architecture supports all languages

## Problem Analysis

Currently, when analyzing code like:

```typescript
// File: scope_resolution.ts
import { ScopeGraph } from "./graph";

export function build_scope_graph() {
  const graph = new ScopeGraph();
  graph.insert_global_def(def);  // This method call is not resolved
}
```

The call to `insert_global_def` is not being linked to the method definition in the `ScopeGraph` class, causing:

1. `insert_global_def` appears as a top-level node (never called)
2. `build_scope_graph` shows 0 outgoing calls instead of 1
3. The call graph is incomplete

## Root Cause

The current implementation:

1. Resolves the import `ScopeGraph` to the class definition
2. Tracks `new ScopeGraph()` as a constructor call
3. But does NOT track that the variable `graph` is an instance of `ScopeGraph`
4. When resolving `graph.insert_global_def()`, it only looks for a local definition of `graph`, not its type

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add instance type tracking**:
   - When we see `new ClassName()`, track that the assigned variable is an instance of `ClassName`
   - Store this type information in a map: `variable_name -> class_name`

2. **Enhance method call resolution**:
   - When resolving a method call like `obj.method()`:
     - First resolve `obj` to its definition
     - Check if `obj` has associated type information
     - If it's an instance of a class, resolve the class (possibly through imports)
     - Look up the method in the class definition

3. **Update `get_calls_from_definition`**:
   - Add logic to track variable types from constructor calls
   - Enhance the method resolution logic to use type information

4. **Handle edge cases**:
   - Method calls after variable reassignment
   - Method calls on objects passed as parameters
   - Chained method calls (`obj.method1().method2()`)

## Technical Details

Key areas to modify:

- `project_call_graph.ts`: Add type tracking in `get_calls_from_definition()`
- Consider adding a `variable_types` map to track `variable -> className` mappings
- When we see a constructor call pattern, store the type
- When resolving method references, check the variable's type and resolve through the class

## Example Implementation Approach

```typescript
// In get_calls_from_definition
const variableTypes = new Map<string, string>(); // variable name -> class name

// When we see: const graph = new ScopeGraph()
// Track: variableTypes.set("graph", "ScopeGraph")

// When we see: graph.insert_global_def()
// 1. Resolve "graph" -> variable definition
// 2. Check variableTypes.get("graph") -> "ScopeGraph"
// 3. Resolve "ScopeGraph" (possibly through imports)
// 4. Find method "insert_global_def" in the ScopeGraph class
// 5. Create the function call link
```

## Implementation Notes

After investigation, we discovered that the tree-sitter scope queries were not properly capturing method references. The queries existed but weren't working as expected.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed reference insertion**: Modified `graph.ts` to always insert references, even when they can't be immediately resolved. This ensures method references are captured in the graph.

2. **Added type tracking**: In `get_calls_from_definition()`, we now track variable types when we see constructor calls (`new ClassName()`). This creates a map of variable names to their class types.

3. **Implemented method resolution**: When we encounter a method reference that can't be resolved directly, we:
   - Check if it's a method call on a typed variable
   - Look up the variable's type from our tracking map
   - Resolve the class definition (possibly through imports)
   - Find the method within the class definition using enclosing ranges

4. **Added enclosing range computation**: For classes that don't have enclosing_range set during parsing, we compute it dynamically using the AST to ensure we can properly check if methods belong to a class.

5. **Updated tests**: Fixed the test expectations to reflect that methods are no longer incorrectly marked as top-level nodes.

### Key Changes

- `packages/core/src/graph.ts`: Always insert references, even unresolved ones
- `packages/core/src/project_call_graph.ts`: Added type tracking and method resolution logic
- `packages/core/src/scope_resolution.ts`: Ensured method references with `symbol_kind: 'method'` are properly captured
- `packages/core/tests/call_graph.test.ts`: Updated test expectations

The solution works for all supported languages as it uses the existing tree-sitter query patterns that already distinguish method calls in each language.

### Current Limitations

The implementation has a significant limitation: it only works when the class definition and method calls are in the same file. Cross-file method resolution is not yet supported because:

1. **Variable type tracking is scoped to individual functions**: When processing a function, we track variable types only within that function's scope.
2. **Import resolution happens separately**: While we can resolve imported classes, this information is not connected to the variable type tracking.
3. **No persistent type information**: Type information is not persisted across function boundaries or files.

To fully support cross-file method resolution, we would need:
- Global or file-level type tracking
- Integration between import resolution and type tracking
- Type inference across function boundaries
- Possibly a two-pass analysis approach

For now, the implementation successfully:
- Captures method references in all languages
- Resolves methods when the class is defined in the same file
- Provides the foundation for future improvements

Implemented method resolution for same-file classes, cross-file support requires additional work
