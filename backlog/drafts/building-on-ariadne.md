# Building on Ariadne

## High-level features to add

- Link together top-level of the project i.e. docs, top-level functions so there is a singular tree of knowledge for the project
- Call graphs -> Flow charts
- Refactoring help
  - Concisely display call graph

## Strategy

- There is probably a lot of value in further prototyping of the features in the code-charter repo.
- Then we can split the modules out (e.g. `ui`, *future* `)
