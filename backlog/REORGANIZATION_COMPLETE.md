# Task Reorganization Complete ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Epic Structure

Created 10 epics with clear priorities and focused goals:

- **HIGH Priority:** Type System (1), Performance (4), Test Maintenance (9)
- **MEDIUM Priority:** Import/Export (2), MCP Server (5), Call Graph (6), Documentation (7), Language Expansion (10)
- **LOW Priority:** Language Support (3)
- **COMPLETED:** Bug Fixes (8) - archived for reference

### 2. Task Migration

- ✅ Moved 21 task-100 sub-tasks to appropriate epics
- ✅ Moved 26 standalone tasks to relevant epics
- ✅ Archived 14 completed tasks to epic-8-completed
- ✅ Deleted 2 duplicate tasks (100.35, 100.36)

### 3. Documentation

- ✅ Created comprehensive README for each epic
- ✅ All epics reference `@rules/refactoring.md`
- ✅ Added initial audit tasks to epics 1, 2, and 6
- ✅ Created test split tasks for oversized files (51KB and 41KB)
- ✅ Updated WORK_PRIORITY.md with new structure

### 4. Operations Structure

- ✅ Created `backlog/tasks/operations/` for recurring processes
- ✅ Created `backlog/tasks/epics/` for organized feature work
- ✅ Moved agent validation process to operations
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with new structure documentation

## Benefits Achieved

2. **Focus:** Related work grouped together
3. **Prioritization:** Clear HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priorities
4. **Progress Tracking:** Easy to see completed vs pending work
5. **Standards:** All epics reference @rules/refactoring.md

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

2. Run initial audits for Epics 1, 2, and 6
3. Document current limitations in README

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. Complete audit tasks and generate refactoring sub-tasks
2. Begin high-priority work in Type System epic
3. Address test file size issues

### Ongoing

1. Track progress in epic READMEs
2. Run weekly validation process
3. Update metrics and priorities weekly

## Files Modified
